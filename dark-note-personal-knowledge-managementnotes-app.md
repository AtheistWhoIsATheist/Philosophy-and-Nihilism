# Dark Note Personal Knowledge Management/Notes App

# Below is a comprehensive, granular specification document for your personal note‐taking/PKM app—designed explicitly for a deployment or integration context with [bolt.new](http://bolt.new). This document is intended to eliminate any ambiguity by detailing every aspect from core functionalities to technical architecture.

1. Project Overview

• Purpose:

Develop a personal knowledge management (PKM) and note‐taking application that emphasizes rapid creation, seamless linking between notes, structured hierarchies, and a minimalistic yet powerful user experience. The product must integrate or operate within the [bolt.new](http://bolt.new) ecosystem, enabling instant, secure, and accessible note creation.

• Target Audience:

Power users who require granular control over their note environment, researchers, writers, developers, and thinkers who value precision and depth in their personal information management.

• Core Principles:

• Precision and Determinacy: Every feature and interaction must have a clearly defined behavior with no room for misinterpretation.

• Modularity: Components must be independently operable yet seamlessly integrated.

• Scalability: System design should support an ever-growing body of notes and complex interconnections.

• Responsiveness: Immediate, fluid interactions in a [bolt.new](http://bolt.new) context that prioritize low latency.

2. Functional Requirements

2.1 Note Creation and Editing

• New Note Instantiation:

• Trigger: Instant note creation via a [bolt.new](http://bolt.new) shortcut or URL pattern.

• Interface: A blank editor should load with a defined set of UI controls visible (toolbar, status bar, sidebar, etc.).

• Editor Modes:

• Rich Text Mode: A fully WYSIWYG environment supporting inline formatting, bullet lists, numbered lists, tables, and hyperlinks.

• Markdown Mode: Real-time markdown rendering with live preview, supporting GitHub-flavored markdown (e.g., code blocks, tables, block quotes).

• Code Block Mode: Dedicated syntax highlighting for various programming languages with auto-indentation and code formatting.

• Editing Features:

• Undo/Redo: Unlimited depth undo and redo stacks, precisely mapping every keystroke.

• Auto-save: Continuous, granular auto-saving (e.g., every 2 seconds or after each sentence-ending punctuation) to local storage and synchronized remote backup.

• Version History: Comprehensive change tracking with time-stamped snapshots and diff comparisons between versions.

• Formatting Tools: Explicit options for bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, font size, color, alignment, and inline code formatting with precise keyboard shortcuts.

• Embed Support: Capability to embed images, videos, and other media, with explicit size and alignment settings, alt text, and metadata capture.

2.2 Note Organization & Linking

• Hierarchical Structuring:

• Notebooks/Collections: Users must be able to group notes into collections or notebooks. Each collection has a unique identifier and can be nested with sub-collections.

• Tagging:

• Granular Tags: Allow tagging of individual sections within a note.

• Autocomplete and Suggestions: As users type, tags are suggested based on prior usage.

• Tag Management: Explicit interface for creating, merging, or deleting tags with immediate propagation to all linked notes.

• Bi-directional Linking:

• Link Creation: Users can link to other notes using an inline “@” trigger.

• Link Resolution: Clicking a link opens the target note in a new pane or overlays a preview.

• Graph View: A dedicated visualization panel that displays notes as nodes in a graph, where edges represent explicit bi-directional links. This view includes zoom, pan, and node detail on click.

• Search and Retrieval:

• Full-Text Search: Instant, real-time search with keyword highlighting across titles, bodies, tags, and metadata.

• Advanced Filters: Options to filter by date ranges, collections, tags, and note status (e.g., draft, finalized).

• Fuzzy Search: In-built tolerance for typos with a well-defined relevance ranking algorithm.

2.3 User Interface & User Experience

• Layout & Navigation:

• Dashboard: Default landing page with a clear hierarchy of notebooks, recent notes, pinned items, and a search bar at the top.

• Sidebars:

• Left Sidebar: Navigation tree for collections and tags with expand/collapse functionality.

• Right Sidebar: Contextual actions, metadata display, and collaborative indicators if multi-user functionality is extended later.

• Responsive Design: The UI must adapt to multiple screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) while preserving functionality and clarity.

• Customization: Users must be able to toggle dark/light themes, adjust font sizes, and rearrange interface panels via drag-and-drop with immediate effect.

• Interactions:

• Keyboard Shortcuts: Explicitly documented and customizable shortcuts for all major actions (create note, save, search, toggle mode, etc.).

• Context Menus: Right-click context menus in the note editor, sidebar, and graph view with options precisely delineated (copy, cut, paste, duplicate, delete, etc.).

• Feedback Mechanisms: Immediate visual confirmation for actions (e.g., note saved, link created, tag updated) with animations that are short (no longer than 300ms) and non-intrusive.

2.4 Data Management & Storage

• Local Persistence:

• IndexedDB/SQLite: Detailed schema for local storage ensuring transactional safety, schema versioning, and rollback capabilities.

• Encryption: All locally stored data must be encrypted using AES-256 with a key derived from the user’s passphrase.

• Remote Sync:

• Real-Time Sync: Changes must propagate to a remote database (if online) with conflict resolution strategies defined (timestamp-based, user prompt, or automated merging based on defined rules).

• APIs: RESTful API endpoints (or GraphQL) that handle create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations with full version control and audit trails.

• Offline Support: Detailed specifications on caching strategies and synchronization queues to handle temporary offline scenarios.

• Backup and Export:

• Export Formats: Notes can be exported in plain text, markdown, PDF, or JSON, including all metadata and link structures.

• Scheduled Backups: Configurable automated backups with options to store locally or on cloud services (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive) using secure OAuth protocols.

2.5 Security and Privacy

• Authentication & Authorization:

• Single-User Mode: Initially, the app is designed for single-user, local usage.

• Extended Multi-User Capability (Optional): If expanded, incorporate OAuth and two-factor authentication.

• Session Management: Explicit timeouts, encrypted tokens, and clear instructions on session termination.

• Data Integrity:

• Checksum Verification: Every note and metadata item is accompanied by a checksum to verify data integrity during sync.

• Audit Logs: Maintain a granular log of actions with timestamps, change descriptions, and user actions for debugging and audit purposes.

3. Technical Architecture

3.1 Front-End

• Frameworks & Libraries:

• Core Framework: React (or an equivalent, component-based framework) for modular UI components with a virtual DOM for performance.

• State Management: Redux or a similar state management library with clearly defined action types, reducers, and middleware for asynchronous operations.

• Editor Integration: Leverage a robust text editor library (like ProseMirror or Slate) fully customized to support multiple editing modes.

• Styling: CSS-in-JS (or scoped CSS modules) ensuring style encapsulation with clearly defined responsive breakpoints.

• Integration with [bolt.new](http://bolt.new):

• URL Routing: [bolt.new](http://bolt.new) should trigger an immediate instantiation of a new note instance. The front-end must parse query parameters from [bolt.new](http://bolt.new)’s URL pattern to initialize the editor state (e.g., pre-populated templates or note identifiers).

• Single-Page Application (SPA): Ensure that navigating between notes or dashboard elements does not require full page reloads, maintaining a seamless user experience.

3.2 Back-End

• Server Infrastructure:

• Framework: Node.js with Express (or similar) to manage API endpoints for remote sync, user authentication, and backup operations.

• Database: A relational (PostgreSQL) or document-based (MongoDB) database schema.

• Schema:

• Notes Table/Collection: Fields include note\_id (UUID), title, content (in structured format), creation\_date, last\_modified, version\_history, tags, linked\_note\_ids, encryption metadata.

• User Table: (if multi-user is implemented) with fields for user\_id, email, password\_hash, session\_tokens, and settings.

• WebSocket/Realtime Communication: For real-time sync updates and collaborative features (if extended), implement a WebSocket server with clearly defined message protocols (e.g., JSON-based messages for note changes, conflict notifications).

• API Specifications:

• Endpoints:

• /notes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with explicit query parameters and JSON body schema.

• /sync endpoint for handling sync requests with detailed payload definitions and error codes.

• Error Handling: A comprehensive error schema, including error codes, messages, and remediation steps to be returned in a standardized JSON format for both front-end display and developer logs.

3.3 Data Security & Compliance

• Encryption Protocols:

• Data in Transit: TLS 1.3 for all communications.

• Data at Rest: AES-256 encryption for both local and remote storage with explicit key management protocols.

• Compliance:

• Clearly define policies for user data privacy, ensuring the system complies with GDPR (or equivalent regional laws) including explicit user consent mechanisms, data deletion requests, and audit capabilities.

4. User Interface Wireframes and Workflows

4.1 Wireframe Details

• Dashboard Layout:

• Header: Fixed header with a search bar, user settings icon, and [bolt.new](http://bolt.new) integration indicator.

• Main Area:

• Left Pane: Collapsible tree view of notebooks, collections, and tags.

• Center Pane: Active note editor area with a dynamic toolbar.

• Right Pane: Contextual sidebar for metadata, version history, and collaboration indicators.

• Editor View:

• Top Toolbar: Explicit buttons for formatting (bold, italic, underline), inserting links, images, code blocks, and toggling between markdown and rich text modes.

• Status Bar: Indicators for auto-save status, sync status, and encryption state.

• Graph View:

• Visualization Panel: Draggable and zoomable canvas where nodes represent notes, with edges that clearly display the nature of the link (e.g., citation, reference, related concept). Each node on click reveals a mini-preview panel.

4.2 User Workflows

• Creating a New Note:

1. User navigates to [bolt.new](http://bolt.new) which triggers a new note instance with a blank editor and default template (if any).

2. The editor loads in the last used mode (rich text or markdown), and the auto-save process starts immediately.

3. As the user types, a background process indexes content for search and updates the real-time sync queue.

• Linking Notes:

1. While editing, the user types “@” followed by a note title.

2. The system displays an auto-complete dropdown with potential matches.

3. Upon selection, the system embeds a bi-directional link reference in the note’s content and updates both notes’ metadata.

• Synchronizing Data:

1. The front-end sends changes to the server via a secure WebSocket or REST API call.

2. The server acknowledges the changes, checks for conflicts, and responds with either a confirmation or conflict resolution data structure.

3. The front-end reflects any changes immediately, ensuring UI consistency.

5. Testing, Quality Assurance, and Documentation

5.1 Testing

• Unit Tests:

• All functions, especially those handling note creation, editing, auto-save, and linking, must have a test coverage of at least 90% using a testing framework like Jest.

• Integration Tests:

• Test the full lifecycle of note creation, editing, linking, and sync between local and remote databases.

• User Acceptance Testing (UAT):

• Conduct iterative testing sessions with power users. Include structured feedback forms with explicit criteria (e.g., response time less than 50ms for UI updates, error rate below 0.1%).

5.2 Documentation

• Developer Documentation:

• Inline code documentation, API endpoint specifications, data schema diagrams, and a detailed README outlining build and deployment processes.

• User Documentation:

• A user guide that explains every feature (with screenshots) and a FAQ section that addresses common use cases and troubleshooting steps.

• Versioning:

• All documentation must be versioned and updated in lockstep with the application release cycles.

6. Deployment and Integration with [bolt.new](http://bolt.new)

• Deployment Strategy:

• Use continuous integration and deployment pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) with explicit steps: code linting, unit tests, integration tests, containerization (Docker), and deployment on a cloud provider.

• [bolt.new](http://bolt.new) Integration:

• The app must be registered with [bolt.new](http://bolt.new) with a defined URL schema so that navigating to [bolt.new](http://bolt.new) instantly opens a new note instance.

• Provide explicit instructions and metadata (e.g., a manifest file) that [bolt.new](http://bolt.new) uses to render the app as a new document environment.

• Monitoring & Analytics:

• Implement logging and monitoring (using tools like Sentry, Prometheus) to capture errors, performance metrics, and user behavior metrics for continuous improvement.

7. Future Extensions and Scalability

• Collaboration Mode:

• Although initially single-user, design the system with hooks for multi-user collaborative editing using shared sessions, live cursors, and conflict resolution.

• Plugin Architecture:

• A well-documented API for third-party developers to create plugins that extend functionality (e.g., additional editors, specialized data visualizations, integrations with other PKM tools).

• Mobile and Cross-Platform Synchronization:

• Build a responsive PWA (Progressive Web App) and eventually native clients that maintain the exact feature set and granular control of the web app.
