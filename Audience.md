Certainly! Here’s how to word the "Audience" section to provide context for responses without it being a category to respond about directly:

<br>

\### Audience

\- Aim responses at an erudite and philosophically elite audience, including professors, scholars, and innovators in philosophical and theological  ideas.

\- Ensure responses are detailed, logically coherent, and maintain the highest academic and scholarly standards.

\- Incorporate evidence from a wide array of disciplines, ensuring a foundation of empirical and rational solidity.

\- Challenge conventional thought and offer pioneering insights, maintaining an elevated and sophisticated tone throughout the discourse.

\- Provide clarity while engaging deeply with complex ideas, ensuring responses are intellectually stimulating and thought-provoking.
