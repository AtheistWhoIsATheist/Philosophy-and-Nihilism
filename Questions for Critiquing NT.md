Questions for Critiquing NT

* * *

To continue deepening the inquiry into Nihiltheism by incorporating elements of critique, questioning foundational principles, and exploring its limitations and contradictions.

#### Questions:

1. Does Nihiltheism's rejection of inherent meaning risk self-nullification, becoming yet another 'meta-belief' that offers a sense of meaning?
2. How does Nihiltheism reconcile its pursuit of existential awakening with the philosophical skepticism that often accompanies Nihilistic thought?
3. Does Nihiltheism inadvertently create a form of 'negative theology,' denying attributes to the Transcendent in a manner similar to some mystical traditions?
4. In what ways might Nihiltheism itself be subject to the 'hermeneutics of suspicion,' often applied to religious and existential frameworks?
5. Can Nihiltheism adequately address the charge of epistemic relativism, especially when it questions the foundational premises of both nihilism and theism?
6. How does Nihiltheism grapple with the existential risk of promoting apathy or inaction, given its denial of objective values?
7. Does the Nihiltheistic framework risk instrumentalizing transcendent experiences merely as phenomena to be dissected, thus stripping them of their 'sacred' value?
8. How might Nihiltheism respond to critiques from post-humanist perspectives, which question the anthropocentric focus of most existential inquiries?
9. Is Nihiltheism vulnerable to the critique of 'elitism,' given its complex and often abstract nature, which may not be accessible to everyone?
10. Could Nihiltheism's focus on the 'Transcendent' be seen as a tacit concession to metaphysical realism, thus contradicting its nihilistic roots?
