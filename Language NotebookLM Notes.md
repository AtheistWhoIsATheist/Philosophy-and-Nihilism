**Nihilism and Transcendence are interconnected concepts that challenge traditional notions of meaning and existence**.

- Nihilism asserts that life lacks inherent meaning or value, leading to feelings of despair and emptiness.
- Transcendence, on the other hand, suggests the possibility of moving beyond this meaninglessness and experiencing a deeper reality.
- A language that encapsulates both Nihilism and Transcendence must acknowledge the existential dread and absurdity inherent in Nihilism while also expressing the possibility of finding meaning and purpose beyond the void.
- It should be open-ended, symbolic, and self-critical, allowing for diverse interpretations and avoiding the limitations of traditional religious or philosophical language.
- Heidegger's comprehensive language about the human condition, with concepts like anxiety, authenticity, and being-towards-death, provides a foundation for developing such a language.
- The concept of "Nihiltheism" is suggested as a term to ground this 'genre' of human experience, emphasizing the need for a language that transcends traditional religious and atheistic paradigms.

# Outline of Nihiltheism

- (me): Similar to [[Simplified Summary]]

I. \*\*Nihilism and the Meaninglessness of Human Existence\*\*: - Meaninglessness of life and the absence of serious engagement with religion in most people's lives. - The significance of religion for many individuals, providing meaning, purpose, and coping mechanisms. - Accepting the meaninglessness of life liberates us from the pursuit of meaning in all actions.

II. \*\*Nihiltheism: Embracing Nothingness and Transcendence\*\*:

\- Nihiltheism combines traditional nihilism with the view of Nothingness as a construct or embodiment of the Transcendent/Divine.

\- It involves actively engaging with Nothingness in the physical world as a reminder of Transcendence.

\- Nihiltheism connects with various philosophical and religious traditions, including existentialists, Christian mystics, and Eastern philosophies.

\- Figures like Emil Cioran and Paul Tillich share common ground under Nihiltheism's lens.

III. The Pursuit and Participation with Temporal Nihility:

\- Nihiltheism suggests immersing oneself in existential despair to fully comprehend it.

\- It acknowledges the impossibility of participating in this state for an extended period.

\- This pursuit of Temporal Nihility is found in different thinkers and traditions, such as William James, Soren Kierkegaard, and Plato.

\- Nihiltheism considers the Nothingness of the physical world as an undeniable reality.

IV. The Transcendent: Encountering the Wholly Other:

\- Psychedelics play a role in Nihiltheism, triggering Transcendent experiences that align with its principles.

\- Entheogens offer an encounter with an "Infinite Presence" and a union with Everything.

\- These experiences reveal an incorporeal realm of Nothingness, described as "Full" or "Plentiful" Emptiness or Void.

\- The encounters with Transcendence bring a sense of familiarity and "coming home."

V. The Return: Navigating the Tension: - The fleeting connection to the Transcendent leads to a retreat to mundane reality and existential fears.

\- Nihiltheists experience a constant reminder of life's fleeting nature and worldly insignificance.

\- Morality in Nihiltheism involves a state of "non-movement" and non-engagement with the world.

\- Extreme interpretations view moral values as nonexistent and encourage utmost moral inaction.

VI. Conclusion: The Nihiltheistic Paradox:

\- Nihiltheism rejects attempts to move past Nihilism, considering it an evasion of a fundamental existence.

\- It emphasizes the pursuit, participation, and renunciation of the Nothingness of the world.

\- Warning against finding meaning in the meaningless leads to deeper illusions and inauthentic states of being.

\- Nihiltheism stresses the importance of examining existence and preparing for inevitable death, as put forth by Plato.
