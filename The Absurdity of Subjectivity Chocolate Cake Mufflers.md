As for the world you describe - one where people find meaning in car muffler cakes - it may seem strange or undesirable to some, but isn't that the very essence of diversity and freedom? It's a world where individuals are not bound by a single, imposed meaning, but are free to create their own, as long as they do not harm others or infringe on their freedom to do the same.

- Me: Fantastic! Eating mufflers and calling it chocolate cake. Isn't that what freedom is all about?! Hahaha
