## INFRANODUS NOTES FROM JOURNAL314 QUOTES & THE RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE OF NIHILISM

\---  
  
The human sense of existence is found in finite minds, while the infinite mind is beyond people’s understanding. Life and death are spiritual and religious concepts that bring great pain and pleasure, and the search for meaning can be a long journey. The word "thy" symbolizes one’s connection to the world and the passage of time, while the person and their spiritual beliefs are intertwined with the world. Finding peace within oneself can alleviate the fear of nothingness and death, and death can be seen as a virtue. Making friends and seeking true knowledge can bring light to the soul, and through knowledge, one can attain the true self. Nature is experienced through a religious lens, but can also lead to thoughts of nihilism, which can be a form of despair. However, the face of nihilism can be faced and overcome through the experience of the world, which is ultimately seen as good. Sense is intertwined with the world, and through experience, one can attain a deeper understanding of the world and themselves.

Human existence is a finite experience, but the human mind has the ability to perceive the infinite. In this search for meaning, people have found both great pleasure and pain in life. Death, a spiritual and religious concept, is often feared and associated with nothingness and sin. However, some see death as a virtue and a way to attain peace. For those who seek true knowledge and sense, the mind and soul are seen as light that can guide one’s journey. In this world, humans live and experience nature, which can bring both religious fulfillment and a sense of nihilism. However, in the face of despair and nihilism, friendship and making meaningful connections can bring a sense of hope and purpose. Ultimately, the human experience is a long journey that is intertwined with the world and the search for a deeper understanding of life and oneself.
