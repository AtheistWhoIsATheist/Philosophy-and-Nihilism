# # Description of \*\*Nihiltheism\*\*

- Nihiltheism is a philosophy that embraces a traditional view of Nihilism, along with the claim that the essential Nothingness of existence is perceived as an expression, and possibly the embodiment of reality beyond the material world that is Transcendent/Divine. It's not just about understanding existential despair. It's about the deep phenomenology and experiencing the Nothingness within the world. Nihiltheism encourages an active engagement with the Nothingness in our physical world, ascetic in nature, as a "reminder” of the Transcendent, and the process of renouncing of the world and anything finite in nature. 

- This philosophy connects with a wide range of philosophical and religious traditions, including existentialists like Soren Kierkegaard and Martin Heidegger, Christian mystics like Meister Eckhart and Miguel de Molinos, and Eastern philosophies like Swami Vivekananda’s Vedanta, Buddhism, and Taoism, which all, in some way, accept or embrace a “Nothingness” to human existence. Even figures like Emil Cioran and Paul Tillich, who may initially seem at odds with each other, share common ground under the lens of Nihiltheism. 

- Unlike philosophies offering ways to avoid existential despair, Nihiltheism suggests immersing oneself within it, while also acknowledging the impossibility of participating in this state of being for any extended period of time. This is the same insight that is found throughout many thinkers in the history of philosophy and religion. For example, William James’ “divided-self”, Soren Kierkegaard’s “double-mindedness”, Martin Heidegger’s “always falling” into the they, Plato’s distain for the human body as it drags one inevitably back down into the world and away from The Forms, Vivekananda’s fight of relinquishing the ego, and even the “original sin” of Christianity. Nihiltheism views the Nothingness of the physical world as an undeniable reality.

- This worldview questions if our experience of Nihilism can be fully explained by science, and wonders if it could signify something Divine. This is where psychedelics are noteworthy within Nihiltheism. Particular psychedelic medicines can trigger Transcendent experiences that align with its key tenets, such as the death of the ego, a oneness with everything, and a full renunciation of the human (which includes all it’s subjective joys and sorrows). &nbsp; 

- When these psychedelic medicines are pursued properly, which include much philosophical contemplation, correct set and setting, along with an intent to peak beyond the veil and possibly encountering the Infinite, can affirm Nihiltheistic insights, such as the illusory nature of values. The consequences that shape our understanding of the world. The psychedelic journey unfolds, the boundaries of physical reality may dissolve, revealing an incorporeal realm of Nothingness. This "Full" Nothingness, Emptiness, or Void is not a mere absence or negation, but rather a profound presence that defies conventional comprehension. It is an experience that is simultaneously terrifying and beautiful, evoking a sense of awe and wonder at the entirety of physical reality, revealing an incorporeal realm of Nothingness that can be described, in a similar manner as many of those have that are within the mystical traditions, as a a “Full” Nothingness, Emptiness, or Void. This experience is one that is terrifyingly beautiful, completely other-worldly and unimaginable, yet one is left perceiving this “space” as if one has been there before, a sense of the familiar, as if one has “come home”. 

- Living as a Nihiltheist involves a constant confrontation with the Nothingness of the world, as a reminder of life's fleeting nature and the physical world's insignificance. Morality is perceived uniquely in Nihiltheism, adopting a stance of "non-movement". In practice, this perspective may resemble mere pacifism or the Taoist philosophy of non-engagement with the world, often described as "doing nothing."&nbsp; 

- However, in the extreme interpretation of moral values being considered nonexistent, Nihiltheism takes this moral inaction to its utmost extent. The Nihiltheist does no harm, not in order to “do good” or “avoid evil”, but as a step in the renunciation of the physical world.

- The philosophy holds back from making assertions of knowledge due to it being replete with an irresolvable doubt. Mere suggestions fight against any dogmatic conceptions or demands.
