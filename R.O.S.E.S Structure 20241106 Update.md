## Conclusion

While all structures have their merits, those mentioned above—\*\*RASCEF, PECRA, ROSES, and GRADE\*\*—stand out for their comprehensive, purpose-driven, scenario-based, and goal-oriented approaches. They facilitate deeper engagement with philosophical inquiries, allowing for a nuanced exploration of complex ideas such as Nihilism. By providing clear frameworks that emphasize context, purpose, and systematic progression, these structures enhance the quality and depth of philosophical analysis.
