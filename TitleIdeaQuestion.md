# Title/Idea/Question

## /date 

## Hashtags, backlinks, notebooks

### TOC

* * *

  

## Note Reminders!

### \- # or /\[\[ every note for I open and write in with "Yesterday". 

### \- Dates, Hashtags & Backlinks (put on all notes related to each other)

**

- \*\*EVERY NOTE, EVERY TIME\*\*
- Use “ #now” for most recent notes
- Use “#” & “Role”, Ex. “#ProfNihil” for a focused notebook. (e.g. ProfNihil & AutoNihil)
- "Projects" = "#anthology"

- Hashtag or Backlink can go anywhere on the page. Can organize later, no need to fix in real time 

- CHECK OUTLINE for EASY NAVIGATION: the lowercase “i” inside the circle, bottom right of your screen, you idiot!  Ctrl + f to find “on page” or throughout notebook.

- Look Over Yesterday's Work & Notes (‘#now’, and [[./Quick Notes]])
- Don't Delete Anything Prematurely, Leave box check/text crossed/grayed and do this:
    - [x] Example on what to do. Indent Twice, keep checked checkbox for reference (because I can still see through crossed out/grayed), update w/new ideas

- To Emphasize Inside Code Blocks: Use ALL CAPS, Special Characters:  '!!!' or '###' before and after the text. NOT: {...} in code block = ignore.
