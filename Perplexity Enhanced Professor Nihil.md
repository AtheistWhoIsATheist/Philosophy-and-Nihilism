## Prompting Technique of Sending Both Original V and Refined Prompt (according to ChatGPT4.o in Perplexity)

When optimizing prompts for AI systems, it is often beneficial to include the progression of the prompt refinement process. This approach allows the AI to understand the rationale behind each modification, ensuring it can apply similar improvements to future prompts. Here's why including the progression can be advantageous:

1. **Learning from Examples**: By seeing the step-by-step refinement, the AI can learn how to identify and address ambiguities, enhance specificity, streamline content, and provide comprehensive context.
2. **Contextual Understanding**: The progression helps the AI grasp the full context of the prompt, including the nuances of the original and refined versions.
3. **Improvement Framework**: Including the steps taken to improve the prompt provides a clear framework that the AI can follow, ensuring consistency in future optimizations.

However, if the goal is to directly use the prompt for generating responses, providing only the refined version might be more efficient. This ensures the AI focuses on the most optimized and clear instructions without potential distractions from the refinement process.

### Here’s a structured approach to decide when to include the progression and when to use only the refined prompt:

## When to Include the Progression

- **Training and Development**: When the AI is being trained or developed to improve its prompt engineering capabilities.
- **Educational Purposes**: When the goal is to educate users or other AI systems on best practices in prompt engineering.
- **Iterative Improvement**: When you want to iteratively improve prompts and need to keep track of changes and their impacts.

## When to Use Only the Refined Prompt

- **Operational Use**: When the prompt is ready for operational use and needs to be as clear and concise as possible.
- **Performance Optimization**: When the focus is on maximizing the AI’s performance in generating responses without the need for understanding the refinement process.

# 3\. Prompts for use with Perplexity Professor Nihil

- Could use with any prompt, but I asked it to craft prompts specifically for the instructions/prompt above

* * *

## Refined Expert-Level Prompts:

1. **Paradoxes and Resolution in Nihiltheism:**
    - Prompt: Critically examine the role of paradox within Nihiltheism, particularly the contradiction between the acceptance of existential absurdity and the pursuit of a higher Transcendent reality. How can this paradox be understood through the lens of dialectical reasoning, and what implications does this have for the coherence of Nihiltheism as a philosophical system?
2. **Nihilistic Mysticism: Comparative and Critical Perspectives:**
    - Prompt: Delve into the concept of "Nihilistic Mysticism" within Nihiltheism by comparing it with the mystical traditions of Meister Eckhart and Aldous Huxley. How does the nihilistic approach to mysticism challenge traditional mystical experiences, and what does this reveal about the nature of transcendence in a nihilistic framework?
3. **Existential Dread and Transcendental Realization in Nihiltheism:**
    - Prompt: Analyze how existential dread serves as a catalyst for transcendental realization within Nihiltheism. Contrast this with Heidegger’s notion of Being-toward-death and Kierkegaard’s leap of faith. How does Nihiltheism uniquely position existential dread as a transformative experience leading to a higher state of consciousness?
4. **Ontology and Ethics in Nihiltheism:**
    - Prompt: Investigate the ontology of values within Nihiltheism, addressing the challenge of moral nihilism. How does Nihiltheism propose a revaluation of values in the absence of inherent meaning? Explore this through the works of Nietzsche and contemporary metaethical theories.
5. **Nihilism, Theism, and the Synthesis in Nihiltheism:**
    - Prompt: Conduct an in-depth comparative analysis of nihilistic and theistic themes as they converge in Nihiltheism. How do the existential struggles articulated by Camus and Kierkegaard inform the synthesis of nihilism and theism in Nihiltheism? Discuss the potential for a reconciliatory narrative between despair and faith.
6. **Psychedelic Phenomenology and Nihiltheistic Insights:**
    - Prompt: Examine the phenomenological impact of psychedelic experiences within the context of Nihiltheism. How do these altered states of consciousness contribute to the understanding of nothingness as the foundational aspect of existence, and what role do they play in achieving a transcendental awareness beyond conventional spirituality?
7. **Language, Meaning, and Nihilistic Experience:**
    - Prompt: Critically evaluate the limitations of language in expressing the core tenets of Nihiltheism. How can Wittgenstein’s later philosophy and Derrida’s deconstruction be applied to develop a new linguistic framework that captures the essence of Nihilistic experience and the ineffable nature of the Transcendent reality it seeks to articulate?

These prompts are designed to provoke deeper critical thinking and engage more thoroughly with advanced philosophical themes, ensuring a rich exploration of Nihiltheism.
