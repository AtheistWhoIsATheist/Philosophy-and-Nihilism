# Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting

### Monica 

Implementing a "chain of thought" prompting strategy from the user's end involves crafting prompts that guide the AI through a series of logical steps or asking it to explain its reasoning process. Here's how you can effectively use this approach:

1. **Start with Clear Objectives** : Before initiating the conversation, have a clear idea of the problem you want to solve or the topic you want to explore.

2. **Initial Prompt** : Begin with a prompt that clearly states the problem or asks a question that requires multi-step reasoning. It's essential to be as specific as possible with what you're asking.

3. **Follow-up Based on Response** : After receiving the AI's response, read it carefully to understand its reasoning. Then, create a follow-up prompt that addresses any gaps in the explanation or asks the AI to elaborate on specific points. This step might involve asking the AI to clarify its thought process or to take the next logical step in the reasoning chain.

4. **Iterative Process** : Continue this process iteratively. Each new prompt should build on the AI's previous response, leading it through a logical sequence of thoughts towards a more comprehensive answer or solution.

5. **Encourage Transparency** : Encourage the AI to "show its work" by asking it to provide step-by-step explanations of how it arrived at a particular conclusion or idea.

6. **Adjust as Necessary** : If the AI's responses are not aligning with your objectives or are not sufficiently detailed, adjust your prompts accordingly. This may involve rephrasing questions, providing more context, or explicitly asking for the type of reasoning you expect.

7. **Conclude the Chain** : Once you've reached a satisfactory conclusion or explored the topic to your contentment, you can end the chain of prompts or summarize the discussion to confirm your understanding.

Remember, this is an interactive process that relies on your guidance as the user to steer the conversation. It requires patience and attentiveness to the AI's responses and may sometimes require several iterations to achieve the desired depth of understanding or problem-solving.

# CoT Prompting Steps (by step)

1. Choose topic/question that you want to explore or answer. Ex: â€œ[prompt](prompt:%0A%22I%20need%20to%20write%20an%20article%20about%20the%20rise%20of%20AI%20and%20its%20impact%20on%20jobs.%20What%20are%20some%20important%20points%20I%20should%20cover%20in%20an%20article%20on%20this%20topic?%22)

2. **Brainstorm** ideas

3. Ask for AI to make an **Outline** 

4.
