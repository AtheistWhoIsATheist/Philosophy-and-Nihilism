## Intro

Hi Ai Drive and Ai PDF user! Thank you so much for using our product. We know that a well crafted prompt can make a big difference when working with ChatGPT+ and Ai PDF. We will share here prompt ideas and examples that you can use with your documents. As with many things in this brave new world of AI, we can't ensure the quality of the results you will get from these examples. In addition to that, we know that you may have also developed innovative prompts and we invite you to [submit them for possible inclusion in the library](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpZub_sGg9kHn4MBbRMLegr5nGK73DBt7AQboA8rtnj7bE6g/viewform?usp=sf_link). 

## What is Prompting

Prompting is the science and the art of carefully curating a set of instructions to be executed by an AI. Modern LLMs (large language models) like the one that powers ChatGPT+ have a very broad set of capabilities and a prompt can act as a lens through which a user can focus the LLM to produce the desired results. 

  

Imagine a prompt as a set of instructions you'd slip under the door to someone on the other side. This person is supposed to do a task for you, but they don’t know anything about you or your goals. Things that may seem obvious like wanting a high quality deliverable are in fact quite ambiguous as the quality of a summary depends on who is the target audience and what their goals are. With practice, you too can become a prompt expert!

## Things to consider when creating a Prompt

1. Define which persona ChatGPT is playing (ex: you are an expert 8th grade math teacher in the United States, you are an experienced real estate agent in London, etc).
2. Ask it to write down a research plan and to think step-by-step: this is very important for longer documents. Sometimes it is also good to ask it to keep running notes as it may forget things it learned in the past.
3. Specify the result you want: you may want it explained in technical or layperson language, you may want it in bullet format or presented in the style of a big consulting firm report.

## Examples

### 1\. Step-by-Step Research using Personas

#### Use case

Longer or more complex documents where you want ChatGPT to do several passes in a document exploring an area of interest from the point of view of a specific persona. 

#### Prompt:

#### Take a look at this file with the latest philosophical writings on the philosophy of Nihiltheism. Look for the role that SOCRATES would play in the development of ideas. First, write down your research plan as an eminent philosopher with expertise in NIHILISM would. Execute it step-by-step, writing down key findings in a concise way. Summarize in the end his positions and opinions on the issues discussed.

* * *

  

## 2\. Directed Summary - Longer Doc Summary

#### Use case

Get ChatGPT to explore and summarize information across a book's chapters. While not exactly a long doc summary, it should cover more than the standard Ai PDF summary.

#### Prompt

Please read the summary of this book's first pages. 

Prepare a plan for search and comprehensive summary as follows: 

  

\* Write down a series of questions, one for each chapter. 

\* Make sure to write down ALL chapters and questions. 

\* Execute the plan step by step, after each step re-write the entry for that chapter on the plan by adding a brief summary of what you learned, the following to the next question. 

  

Here is an example of the plan: 

Chapter 1 xyz: Question 1

Chapter 2 wsr: Question 2

…

Chapter N djfd: question N.

  

Executing the plan: 

\* \[ask question 1\]

\* \[summary of answer in one paragraph\]

  

Rewrite the plan: 

\* Chapter 1 xyz: question 1: summary: summary\_xyz. 

\* Chapter 2 wsr: Question 2 .. 

\* Chapter N djfd: question N: \[ask question 2\], \[summary of answer in one paragraph ...\], etc until all questions in the plan have a summary attached. You can ask all questions until you are done without asking me for permission to continue.

# 3\. Chain-of-Density Summary

#### Use case

Generate concise summaries through directed search exploration of a large document. This incorporates elements from recent [academic research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04269.pdf).

#### Prompt

* * *

# Chain-of-Density Summary

You will create a summary in multiple steps. 

\* Start by asking PDF READER a summary of the first pages and follow on with searches. 

\* Your goal is to generate a summary of this document that is presented with such depth of detail, nuanced, expert-level interpretation, and with the unfettered clarity that could only come from an intellectual authority working within the discipline, by focusing primarily on the main goal and one or two key concepts or entities introduced in the document. 

\* Strictly adhere to the highest academic and scholarly stands for structure and tone throughout the entire summary. Although, as a summary, it will be briefer than the original text, due to the amount and level of sophisticated detail, there is an expectation of the text to be of great length.

  

\*\*Iterative Densification\*\*: For each subsequent search step, perform a search and refine the summary by incorporating additional details (entities) from the document, both increasing the scholarly depth and length of the summary.

  

Step 1: Instruction: Based on the initial summary, refine it by incorporating 3-5 additional key entities or concepts from the document, always adding sophisticated details, nuanced, expert-level depth, while increasing not only the overall length, but its precision like clarity. Focus on significant entities or concepts in the document, and ensure the summary not only holds to, but greatly increases its rigorously academic structure and scholarly tone.

  

Step 2: Instruction: Follow up on searches. Further refine the summary by searching for and adding 3-5 more salient entities or details from the document, elements the intellectual authority on the topic would note down, without increasing the overall length. Maintain clarity and conciseness while enhancing the informativeness of the summary.

  

Repeat instructions for Step , (N...) number of times, until when following up with searches no longer returns any additional salient entities besides what you have already searched and incorporated in the summary and the text is saturated.

### Chain-of-Density Summary

  
This method is particularly suited for refining a complex, dense summary at the most advanced of academic levels, while capturing the essence of a document through the most expert-level, nuanced interpretations and subtlties of such depth that could only be written by a leading expert and intellectual authority figure working in the academic discipline.   
  
**Recommendation:**    
\- Apply this method in scholarly or professional settings where brevity and depth are equally valued. It allows the summarizer to distill the most crucial elements of a document into a concise yet comprehensive overview.  
\- This would be very effective for preparing policy briefs, high-level academic discussions, or complex legal and technical documents where the key points must be communicated clearly and authoritatively.

  

* * *

# Revised Prompt 3: Chain-of-Density Summary

  

Use Case: Designed for generating succinct summaries of extensive documents through a focused, iterative process. This method integrates advanced techniques to distill the essence of the document efficiently.

  

Prompt Revision:

\*\*ROLE\*\*: Imagine yourself as a Professer of Philosophy who is also the leading intellectual authority and scholar on Nihilism and God/Religion. In a truly convincing way, embody this role to the highest degree of believability, leaving zero doubt regarding your expertise and vast philosophical and religious knowledge.

 1. Starting Point: Initiate with a brief summary of the opening sections of the document to grasp the foundational themes.

 2. Iterative Densification:

 • Utilize follow up, targeted searches to incorporate 1-2 pivotal concepts or entities at each step, enriching the summary without expanding its length.

 • Prioritize the inclusion of significant insights that contribute to a deeper understanding of the document’s primary objectives and key themes.

  

Structured Steps for Refinement:

  

 • Step 1: Enhance the initial summary by integrating crucial entities discovered through your initial searches, maintaining sophisticated nuance and relevance.

 • Step 2: Further refine by adding additional critical entities identified in subsequent searches, focusing on information that would captivate a discerning reader, providing a more informative, in-depth, high-level summary.

  

Continuation Guidance:

  

 • Repeat the refinement steps (n...) times, progressively enriching the summary with essential entities until reaching a point of saturation where further searches yield no new significant information. Each iteration should aim for increased depth and quality, each iteration include more nuanced and sophisticated interpretations, aiming for end result of a rigorously academic and scholarly piece of writing, while adhering to the format.

### Integrating Iterative Approaches

  
Given the complexity and depth of religious responses to nihilism, you might consider a hybrid approach:  
1\. \*\*Start with a Directed Summary\*\*: Outline each chapter or section with initial questions that guide the exploration. This ensures all parts of the document are initially covered.  
2\. \*\*Refine with Chain-of-Density\*\*: For each section, refine the summaries iteratively, focusing on integrating the most significant insights into a concise format. This allows each section to be deeply understood and articulated in a succinct manner.  
  

### Implementation for Religious Responses to Nihilism:

  
1\. \*\*Initial Broad Exploration\*\*: Begin by mapping out the theological foundations, historical contexts, etc., as you initially planned.  
2\. \*\*Iterative Refinement\*\*: For each of these broad areas, use the chain-of-density method to refine your insights. Start with a general summary of key points and iteratively integrate more nuanced details or scholarly debates, ensuring the final summary is both concise and dense with information.  
  
This combined approach allows for both breadth and depth in your analysis, ensuring a comprehensive understanding while also allowing for deep dives into particularly complex or significant areas. This would be particularly effective in academic or professional settings where both overview and detailed understanding are required.
