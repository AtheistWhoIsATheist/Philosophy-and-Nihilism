# \*\*Chain-of-Density Summary\*\*

Prompt:

You will embark on a comprehensive exploration of the philosophical concept of Nihilism, focusing on writings from the last 20 years. Your task is to generate a rigorously academic summary of each document, ready for publication in an academic philosophical journal. 

  

\*\*Iterative Densification\*\*: For each document, perform the following steps:

  

\*\*Step 1\*\*: Generate an initial summary of the first few pages of the document. Identify and incorporate 5-10 key entities or concepts, increasing the overall length. Ensure the summary remains coherent and philosophically sophisticated.

  

\*\*Step 2\*\*: Refine the summary by searching for and adding 5-10 more salient entities or details from the document. These should be elements a philosophy and religion scholar would note down. Elevate your summary to the level of a Professor of Philosophy or Religion, diving deeper than ever before, extracting nuanced aspects of the text that only the expertise of an elite philosopher and theologian are capable of.

  

\*\*Step 3 and beyond\*\*: Repeat the instructions for Step 2 until your searches do not return additional salient entities besides what you have already searched and incorporated into the academically rigorous summary. 

  

Throughout this process, continuously follow up and search the entirety of the text until you are done finding entities. Do not waste time by asking for permission to continue. Your goal is to compile a list of writings on Nihilism (Author, Title, Publication, Year) and provide a profound, nuanced, and coherent summary of each.

  

Remember, the aim is to enhance the informativeness of the summary with each iteration, adhering to the highest academic standards for ideas, language, and formatting. Happy researching!
