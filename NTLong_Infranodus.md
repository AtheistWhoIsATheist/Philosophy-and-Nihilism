****" The Religious Experience of Nihilism -Nihilism Preface2/19/24  “...turn us into melancholy metaphysicians. The pride of life and glory of the world will shrivel. It is after all but the standing quarrel of hot youth and hoary old. Old age has the last word: the purely naturalistic look at life, however enthusiastically it may begin, is sure to end in sadness. This sadness lies at the heart of every merely positivistic, agnostic, or naturalistic scheme of philosophy. Let sanguine healthy-mindedness do its best with its strange power of living in  the moment and ignoring and forgetting, still the evil background is really there to be thought of, and the skull will grin in at the banquet. In the practical life of  the individual, we know how his whole gloom or glee about any present fact depends on the remoter schemes and hopes with which it stands related. Its  significance and framing give it the chief part of its value. Let it be known to lead nowhere, and however agreeable it may be",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: the religious_experience_of_nihilism]]****
****"in its immediacy, its glow and  gilding vanish.” James  “To this extent, nihilism, as the denial of a truthful world, of being, might be a divine way of thinking.” Nietzsche  “And to come back again to our first question, ”What is the meaning of a philosopher paying homage to ascetic ideals?” We get now, at any rate, a first hint; he wishes to escape from a torture.” Nietzsche   This is a work of infinite ambition and utter worthlessness; a work of questions rather than answers. This is an interpretation of Nihilism that finds ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]****
****" the ‘everyday’ view, the mainstream ‘philosophical’/intellectual definitions, misguided at best.   I will unapologetically quote from a variety of thinkers at length. Why do people have to ‘defend’ the use of other authors? Are you offended for having  to ‘re-read’ something you already ‘know’? Do you simply crave ‘originality’ from an author? Everyone wants to pen their name into ‘eternity’; every one wants to have their words heard; utter garbage. You’ve most likely interpreted  these authors in a different way than in this work, so any quotes that seem  ‘familiar’ should take on a new life for the reader.  “The fact that ‘They’, who hear and understand nothing but loud idle talk, cannot ‘report’ any call, is held against the conscience on the subterfuge that it is ‘dumb’ and manifestly not present-at-hand. With this kind of interpretation the ‘they’ merely covers up its own failure to hear the call and the fact that its  ‘hearing’ does not reach very far.” Heidegger  “Nothing",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]****
****"reveals more an extreme weakness of mind than not to know the misery of a godless man.” Pascal   I fight a battle between smug confidence and complete humility; both are equally paradoxical. The experience from which this work stems is as ‘real’ as anything that pertains to my existence. And yet doubt is at the forefront of every word that is written, every thought that comes into this stream of consciousness. I want to claim ‘Truth’ and I want to ask for ‘help’. This work will include differing tones, and may even seem as if, at least, two authors are writing.  “The neurotic exhausts himself not only in self-preoccupations like hypochondriacal fears and all sorts of fantasies, but also in others: those around  him on whom he is dependent become his therapeutic work project; he takes out his subjective problems on them. But people are not clay to be molded; they  have needs and counter-wills of their own. The neurotic’s frustration as a failed ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]****
****" artist can’t be remedied by anything but an objective creative work of his own.” Becker  “I have all the defects of other people and yet everything they do seems to me inconceivable.” Cioran  When I imagine some kind of mythical encounter with any of the thinkers whose ideas I’ve quoted within this work, I am under no illusions -I’m sure I would perceive even the simple act of being in their presence as something  utterly unbearable.  The ideas expressed inside these pages are not born from within any worldly, mundane existence of the thinkers, regardless of whether  they left behind a ‘vast corpus of works’ or managed to endear a great, almost  hypnotic, influence over the unthinking. And I, resolutely, deny any such claims of being the origin of what is spoken of here. There is but only one Revealer... Not a one, including myself, shall be elevated up onto a pedestal. As Freud proclaimed: “I have found little that is ‘good’ about human beings on the whole. In my experience most of",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]****
****"them are trash, no matter whether they publicly subscribe to this or that ethical doctrine or to none at all. That is something that you cannot  say aloud, or perhaps even think.”   A sentiment with which I emphatically agree with.  And, why am I carrying on about this?  For one simple, and what should be unambiguous, reason:  There are no heroes here. However, what is important concerning these thinkers is the way in which they all, each from their own unique backgrounds and perspectives, articulate a ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]****
****" description of the same insights, as they are revealed through a specific, abstract experience - the experience of Nihilism.  When these revealed insights of  Nihilism are expressed, and further, made possible to be perceived as a unified ‘voice’, they take on a form that represents irrefutability. This is particularly useful for one, such as myself, who does not have a predominantly strong 'way with words'. Even though names are given, the purpose of the quotes is to show a description of a particular experience,  regardless of whether the person writing is a ‘proclaimed’ Christian, Hindu, 'Nihilist', Saint, etc. If the names were not given, it would be of no consequence, as the quotes attempt to show that there is no distinction; one should not be able to intuit the thinker's 'background', the words of all should converge, leaving one with the perception that each thought has emanated from a single, solitary  mind.   As Cioran says: existence is plagiarism. I am not stating any",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]****
****"‘new’  information here. There is nothing to ‘know’. Their words are my words, and my words are their words. I hope that my ‘voice’ gets lost within these pages. There are too many people wanting to be ‘heard’. There are too many mouthnoises from those thinking they have something to actually say. Paradoxically,  even with the quoting of many others, no one deserves to be heard; yet, as a  member of the human species, the present author wishes to not have a ‘voice’.  Pascal, Kierkegaard, Cioran, Vivekananda, Nietzsche, Buber, Heidegger, Tillich, etc. all say the same exact thing within their own idiosyncratic language  games. It ought to be considered plagiarism after one goes down the list of names in that each author describes a universal experience that is, seemingly, available to any human consciousness that is willing to participate.  “Sometimes I think that I am right when I agree with all the ancient teachers, at other times I think they are right when they agree with me. I",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]****

I have to  find my light, just as they found theirs. Their finding the light will not satisfy us ",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]****
****" at all. You have to become the Bible, and not to follow it, excepting as paying reverence to it as a light on the way, as a guide-post, a mark: that is all the value  it has.” Vivekananda  How is any piece of writing considered ‘scholarly’? Moreover, why would anyone want to be restricted by the arbitrary characteristics of ‘scholarly’?     Any person who has written a book, or written down any substantial amount of their own thoughts, and who looks back on these words, and does not wish for everything to be either burned or re-written has become a  worthless ‘philosopher’, not an authentic thinker. Anyone who is ‘proud’ of their work is pathetic. If your work is ‘incomprehensible’ in style or verbiage,  then all the more to it. Reading and ‘working out’ the author’s inner most  thoughts is priceless, in comparison to the ‘polished’ versions we find in ‘Academia’ today.  “When you know quite absolutely that everything is unreal, you then cannot see why you should take the trouble to",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]****
****"prove it.” Cioran  The most important, yet elementary, sentiment is this: No one knows what is ‘going on here’. What am I? Where did I come from? Where am I going? What is the purpose of existence? And so on. Taken as ‘silly’ questions by most and a ‘game’ for most ‘intellectuals’.  “What astonishes me most is to see that all the world is not astonished at its own weakness. Men act seriously, and each follows his own mode of life, not because it is in fact good to follow since it is the custom, but as if each man knew certainly where reason and justice are.” Pascal ",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]****
****" “There is no doubt that creative work is itself done under a compulsion often indistinguishable from a purely clinical obsession. In this sense, what we call a  creative gift is merely the social license to be obsessed. And what we call “cultural routine” is a similar license: the proletariat demands the obsession of  work in order to keep from going crazy. I used to wonder how people could stand the really demonic activity of working behind those hellish ranges in hotel kitchens, the frantic whirl of waiting on a dozen tables at one time, the madness of the travel agent’s office at the height of the tourist season, or the torture of working with a jack-hammer all day on a hot summer street. The answer is so simple that it eludes us: the craziness of these activities is exactly that of the  human condition. They are “right” for us because the alternative is natural desperation. The daily madness of these jobs is a repeated vaccination: against  the madness of the asylum. Look at the",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]****
******************"joy and eagerness with which workers return from vacation to their compulsive routines. They plunge into their work  with equanimity and lightheartedness because it drowns out something more ominous. Men have to be protected from reality.” Becker   There are no universal claims besides that of Nihilism (expand upon the ‘universal’ nature of the subjective ‘truth’ of Nihilism, quotes from Kierkegaard, find others). A self-refuting statement? Nihilism exists within paradox and contradiction. One could sum up Nihilism’s paradoxical nature in a sentence: Nihilism is Nothing and therefore Everything. Nihilism is nonrational.    There are only suggestions and observations here. Some who claim the characteristic of ‘authority’ will demand meditation, others will rail against it. Some will claim fasting is a must, others say make sure you eat plenty. Some will claim the natural world is all there is, others will swear that there is an  Ultimate Reality. And on and on, everyone spewing a",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]******************
******************"particular nonsense, all proclaiming the ‘path’ or the ‘truth’.   Nihilism as described in these pages is the only ‘truth’ that is and can be ‘known’, rather, experienced, by all humans who participate in the  confrontation. There are no ‘paths’ (answers); if there are paths (answers), then ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]******************
******************" there are infinitely many. Anyone who claims any ‘knowledge’ beyond the experience of Nihilism is simply pushing their subjectivity onto you and can be  taken or left at one’s discretion.  “If we have broken discursive reason’s power over the question about the nothing and about being, then we have also decided the fate of the dominance of “logic” within philosophy. The very idea of “logic” dissolves in the vortex of  a more original inquiry.” Heidegger  “That existence is pervaded by nihilating behavior attests to the permanent and indeed obscured manifestness of no-thing that dread originally discloses. But this means original dread is suppressed for the most part in existence. Dread is  there. It’s only napping. Its breath permanently trembles in existence, only slightly in the apprehensive, and inaudibly in the ”Uh húh!” and “Húh uh!” of  those who are busy; best of all in the reserved, surest of all at the heart of  existence that is daring. But this happens only in those for",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]******************
******************"whom it expends itself in order to preserve the ultimate greatness of existence.” Heidegger  “So then he despairs, that is to say, by a strangely preposterous attitude and a complete mystification with regard to himself, he calls this despair. But to despair is to lose the eternal – and of this he does not speak, does not dream. The loss of the earthly as such is not the cause of despair, and yet it is of this he  speaks, and he calls it despairing. What he says is in a certain sense true, only it is not true in the sense in which he understands it; he stands with his face  inverted, and what he says must be understood inversely; he stands and points at that which is not a cause of despair, and he declares that he is in despair, and  nevertheless it is quite true that despair is going on behind him without his knowing it. It is as if one were to stand with one’s back toward the City Hall and the Court House, and pointing straight before him were to say, ”There is the City Hall and the",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]******************

******************" he calls himself “in despair,” he regards himself as dead, as a shadow of himself. But dead he is not; there is, if you will, life in the characterization. In  case everything suddenly changes, everything in the outward circumstances, and the wish is fulfilled, then life enters into him again, immediacy rises again,  and he begins to live as fit as a fiddle. But this is the only way immediacy knows how to fight, the one thing it knows how to do: to despair and swoon – and yet  it knows what despair is less than anything else. It despairs and swoons, and thereupon it lies quite still as if it were dead, like the childish play of “lying dead”; immediacy is like certain lower animals which have no other weapon or means of defense but to lie quite still and pretend they are dead.” Kierkegaard  Criticisms will be misdirected, necessarily.

I will contradict myself, sometimes intentionally and other times for lack of care. If I am perceived as ‘wrong’, and  one assumes some sort of ‘worth’ in their criticism, then I believe the quotes used throughout this work will at least show that I am in good company. You are welcome to not read any further.  I don’t believe anything I think or say. There is no seeking of ‘approval’, there is no justification, as I am only the messenger, not the author.  “With regard to a poet people speak of his having a call; but as for becoming a priest, it seems enough to the generality of men (and that means of Christians) that one has taken an examination.” Kierkegaard  “This will seem to some a silly fiction.” Theresa of Avila These are thoughts discovered within the mystery of existence that will not settle for",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]******************

You can speak about how life is a ‘mystery’, but do you experience what it is like to be in a mystery? Or do you rather keep busy  chasing the phantom of ‘happiness’? What could ever make you ‘content’ in this world? Contentment within the world is a sign of weakness and sickness, and  you’re welcome to it. This is for those who are at the brink of madness, suicide, or are already ‘dead’.  I want to pursue what will make everyone else uncomfortable. I want to pursue madness. I want to work up the courage for suicide. Why attempt to ‘spoil’ another’s enjoyment, if I do not know what I am talking about, nor do I know  the end, assuming there was an end to human existence?

Ha! True philosophers are like children always asking “Why?”. Everyone else is the unthinking robot who either spews their unquestioned, prepackaged ‘story of existence’, or even better, scolds the child for asking such ‘stupid’ questions. Like children, philosophers get stripped of their original, Platonic recollection and therefore  become trapped within the world as unthinking robots. Ask most ‘philosophers’ about their ideas, instead of another thinkers, and watch them scramble for  words.  Memory reminds the soul how all earthly joys end, recalling the death of those who lived at ease; how some died suddenly and were soon forgotten, how  others, once so prosperous, are now buried beneath the ground and men pass by the graves where they lie, the prey of worms, while the mind recalls many other such",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]******************

This work will never be complete, as Nihilism has no ‘solutions’.  “There is no way of reaching the infinite.” Tillich Is this work too ‘serious’? Is taking Nihilism serious some sort of criticism or defect? Logic? Nihilism dissolves its relevancy. Along with it any discomfort  that stems from a meager ‘contradiction’.

There is simply a curiosity that is slavishly driving him forward on a path  that itself is not questioned.  “When I fancied that I stood alone I was really in the ridiculous position of being backed up by all Christendom. It may be, Heaven forgive me, that I did try to be original; but I only succeeded in inventing all by myself an inferior  copy of the existing traditions of civilized religion. The man from the yacht thought he was the first to find England; I thought I was the first to find Europe. I did try to found a heresy of my own; and when I had put the last touches to it,  I discovered that it was orthodoxy.” Chesterton  “You certainly have command of elegant and excellent similitudes, and sentiments: but, when you are engaged in sacred discussions, you apply them  childishly, nay, pervertedly: for you crawl upon the ground, and enter in thought into nothing above what is human.” Luther  One",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]******************

The meaninglessness of human activity is found, not within a subjective value  judgment, but rather in the ignorant finitude of all human activity. The 'pushing forward' of most human mindsets is one that is built upon the ignorance of the experience of Nihilism. Distractions and diversions are written into the  language of 'normal' human beings. What does one do when these distractions  and diversions fail, when the natural mechanisms of consciousness that keep a human 'sane' break down?

Beyond the question of  'possibility' with regards to constructing such a philosophy of religion, is there some demand to do so? Does the Nihilistic experience contain any 'constructive' content that may allow itself to be interpreted as a 'religious' experience? “All great conversions are born from the sudden revelation of life's meaninglessness. Nothing could be more impressive than this sudden apprehension of the void of existence.” Cioran Humans are damned to philosophize, whether this is done in the unlearned fashion of the everyday person who is fooled into thinking he is 'free', 'smart', and 'comfortable' while in the chains of his cliches, or whether done in the style of the lofty analytic philosopher",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]******************

As it is practiced in the American Universities, philosophy has become seemingly nothing more than a fancy  Sudoku puzzle used to satiate the boredom of 'intellectuals'. The claims of Nihilism (taken in their overlapping declarations concerning the 'negative'  status of moral, existential, epistemological, and metaphysical 'truths') have been dispelled, at best, as 'unanswerable', and at worst, as 'unworthy' for  concern, within most of the analytical tradition. Ultimate questions have been diminished into a clash of one incomplete argument against another. “When he has not a book between his fingers he cannot think. When he thinks, he responds to a stimulus (a thought he has read),-finally all he does is to react.

They will then input some small amount of their own thoughts, that rarely constitute much more than a smearing around of the other thinker’s thoughts. The atheist philosopher's with their so-called 'problem of evil' act as if their rejection of a ‘god’, one that can be boxed into the finite human intellect, is somehow the 'intellectually superior' position while conveniently forgetting the  fact that they themselves lack any non-pragmatic ground for trusting human reason within a wholly naturalistic worldview.

We often consider a man religious who can talk well. But this is not religion.”  Vivekananda It is no better on the other side, where one finds 'religious' philosophers shelling out their hubris filled 'theodicies' in a pathetic effort to defend their small god by diminishing the Other into some conception of human 'oughts' or a selfsatisfying version of skepticism that never goes far enough to stop all their  babble about the Other. The scene is as pathetic, if so much so as to be comical, as to be equivalent to a sleep-walker, with a scalpel in his hand, strutting with  confidence into the operating room 'ready' to perform surgery.

This paradigm in philosophy, of the 'supremacy' of reason, is based upon a false interpretation of the Socratic Method that has been deformed by the positivistic, scientism style of thinking that philosopher's, disregarding Heidegger's  warnings, attempt to 'follow' along distorting philosophy into a false counterpart of science.

******************"degree. Is the 'Socratic Method' to be used as a tool for knowledge or is it a way to open up the mystery of human existence? Is this bizarre method of analytic philosophy the explanation for why philosophers are constantly talking past one another, cloaking philosophy into a 'rationalization' for beliefs that are held on other grounds besides 'reason'? Whatever 'philosophy' actually  is, if pursued honestly and fully, does it not lead to skepticism and doubt? Does it not leave one with the question 'Why?'

The present-at-hand must be encountered in just such a way that it does not have any involvement  whatsoever, but can show itself in an empty mercilessness.” Heidegger We may also express Nihilism in the form of a question: first, put into your mind the most meaningful 'thing' of your existence, whether this is family, a project, a cause, a nation, or even 'oneself'. Now, can you imagine what you  hold to be most meaningful, the thing that makes your existence come across as a real possibility, as being worthless, as utterly void of all meaning? I have yet to meet a person with even a slight indication of what this question is  referring to. To answer in the affirmative is to have experienced a deconstructive-terror that runs through one's entire being. There is a vanishing  of any ground that one has placed under the feet of existence. William James puts it this way: “Conceive yourself, if possible, suddenly  stripped of all the emotion with",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]******************

He puts his description in the mouth of his Zarathustra: “What is your greatest experience? It is the hour of the great  contempt. The hour in which even your happiness becomes repulsive to you, and even your reason and virtue. The hour when you say: ""What good is my  happiness! It is poverty and dirt and wretched contentment.

It is all poverty and dirt and wretched contentment!” I prefer the term 'Absurd Perspective'. This is the 'revelation' of the paralyzing  nature of Nihilism that comes from the absence of values, hence making all judgments, movements, efforts, concerns, and offenses as baseless as any other; we are left with any response or action being reduced to Absurdity, since  humans are necessarily forced to make value judgments in a valueless universe. All human movements are motivated by a value judgment. Without moral  values, no non-arbitrary human action can be made.

In short, if there are an  infinite number of 'universes' and, in theory, an infinite number of 'yous', then any decision, in any given situation that is possible, will be made by one of 'you'. Therefore, it is only an illusion when one finds themselves 'caught' in some form of a 'moral crisis', since no matter which option is chosen, whether  you believe it to be the 'right' decision based on intuition, feelings, or from philosophical comtemplation, all other options will also be chosen, by 'you'.

The only way to justify such thought  and behavior, in a universe that itself will eventually die in ruins, is to maintain some neurotic form of justification for the value of being alive. How does one  justify their stance of intrinsic value on life, no matter what (for now stepping back from the proponents of euthanasia or the proclamations of many 'theistic' believers)? The 'logic' of life, that existence is 'better' than non-existence, has not only proceeded without justification, it is rarely even questioned. Worldly  'meaning' is dead.

To wonder as Pascal did: why can't humans sit alone in a room? I'll let Pascal expand on this observation: “Nothing is so insufferable to man as to be completely at rest, without passions, without business, without diversion, without study. He then feels his  nothingness, his forlornness, his insufficiency, his dependence, his weakness, his emptiness. There will immediately arise from the depth of his heart weariness, gloom, sadness, fretfulness, vexation, despair.” This fact, that man is always attempting to do something, shows that there is some search he is on.

People want Simple Salvation; no one wants to participate in the Nothingness. “Hiding facts is not the way to find a remedy.

But we are even more foolish than the ostrich.” Tolstoy I see a world of human bodies, scampering around in ignorant-confusion, within the illusion of confidence, all with their own little, black cloud of death hovering over their heads. “What a Meaningful life!”, shouted the man who's  heart only seconds later unknowingly delivered him into Nothingness.

To develop a language or philosophy of Nihilism leaves  open the possibility that it may indeed lead to, or find no distinction in, madness, suicide or the Other. “And indeed the Christian is, in a certain sense--in an ultimate sense--a ""Nihilist""; for to him, in the end, the world is nothing, and God is all.

Dasein's facticity is such that as long as it is what it is, Dasein remains in the throw, and  is sucked into the turbulence of the 'They's' inauthenticty.” pg. 223 “In everydayness Dasein can undergo dull ‘suffering’, sink away in the dullness of it, and evade it by seeking new ways in which its dispersion in its affairs may  be further dispersed.

To make clear, this 'always falling' has been, at least within Western, Christian cultures, painted with the mythological language of 'original sin' (or with a  scientific, evolutionary tale that reduces consciousness and all of its phenomenons as a mistake or accident). This unbridgeable disconnect between the finite and the Infinite has been excepted only 'intellectually' while shunned,  in action, by almost all with their 'solutions' and 'answers', except the rare few who have the 'stamina' to renounce the world in its entirety and who hold that  reality is simply an unreality. “Meanwhile time passes.

And as for such questions as what it means to live and die – there's nothing to it, it is  commonplace, almost everybody does it. We are thrown into an absurdly indifferent world of sticks and stones and stars and emptiness. Our “situation” is that of a man who falls out of the empire state building. Any attempt at  “justifying” our brief, accelerating fall, the inconceivably short interlude between our breath-taking realization of our “situation” and our inexorable  total destruction, is bound to be equally ludicrous; i.e. whether we choose to say: (a) “This is actually quite comfortable as long as it lasts, let's make the best  of it.” or (b)",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]******************

In any event, both attitudes presuppose an ability to divert ourselves from realizing our desperate “situation,” to abstract, as it were, every single moment of the “fall” out of its irreparable  totality, to cut our lives up into small portions with petty, short time-span goals.” “It is infinitely comic that a man can understand the whole truth about how wretched and petty this world is, etc. -that he can understand this, and then cannot recognize again what he understood; for almost in the same moment he himself goes off and takes part in the same pettiness and wretchedness, takes glory in it and receives glory from it, that is, accepts it.” Kierkegaard “We cannot hide a carrion with roses; it is impossible.

Science, assuming some form of 'realism', as describing 'reality' with physical laws, allows one to predict and 'know' what is or will happen  within the world. However, to stop at this formal description of reality is unphilosophical. The Philosopher wants to ask why the descriptions of science  are the way they are. It is 'understood' that 'particles' and 'molecules' bump into one another in a particular pattern which produce the physical objects that we see around us, including ourselves.

Many religious  interpretations of the human experience are replete with theological assumptions that are not necessarily grounded in human experience; these take  the forms of rituals, prayers, moral declarations, metaphysical claims, and so on.

In other words, religions and their subsequent theologies contain too many assumptions and 'answers' that shun the mystery of existence. Philosophy, on the other hand, as the relentless 'Why?', is what is needed in order to open up the mystery of Being, instead of closing it off and pushing it into a closet.

Right away, in the first of these examples, it should be obvious that this is not to say that one must agree with the soundness of such an argument. Rather, it is that many philosophers do not grasp the ontology, or the ground, that such an  argument is attempting to bring forth. The ontology of values is shown to be misunderstood when there is an epistemological response of: “I can be a good person without God”. Knowing the Good, if there were such a thing, is different from the metaphysical grounding of the Good; to not be able to make a distinction between epistemology and ontology is another example of  unthinking. “No matter how educated you are, if you don't think intensely about death, you are a mere fool.

It is not an answer if it demands the removal of this state; for that is just what cannot be done. He who is in the grip of doubt and meaninglessness cannot liberate himself from this grip but he asks for an answer which is valid within and not outside the situation of despair. He asks for the ultimate foundation of what we  have called the 'courage of despair.'

Could suicide represent the pinnacle  of the rational life realized?” His suicide suggests the impossibility of such an existence; or rather the utter rationality of suicide in a non-rational world. In his two-thousand page suicide note, Heisman expresses a propulsion towards a new language of Nihilism that though he may have been seeking  after, he could not find.

Is there anything behind this thought that drives  two thinkers, as seemingly as diverse as Heisman and Underhill, that has been forgotten amongst the busyness of the world, which suggests something fundamental about the human condition?

The modern barbarity of ‘saving’ the suicidal is based on a hair- raising misapprehension of the nature of existence.” Zapffe The issue is way more complex than this black and white illustration. The 'jumping' suicides of 9/11 are one such example of the complexity of 'suicide'; there is a possibility that these are not even 'suicides' in any 'real' sense. With  that said, there does seem to be something missing from the common suicide that is not lacking in Heisman's. This 'something' seems to be that the common suicide is worldly and concerned with the ego, rather than the transcendent-self  (although one could forcefully argue that Heisman was driven by his ego).

At all events, remember that a day will come when you in your turn will  lie on your bed of sickness, while others dance and make merry.” “Moreover, it is largely customary to mock at the melancholy; and in good society it is an unwritten law that every one shall bring a certain quota of contentment and gayety, or else remain in chambered solitude.” Saltus Suicide need not be necessary even when it is not taken as an abomination.

The groundwork for a wholly Transcendent experience is laid within in the experience of the Nothing of the world which allows for the further possibility of an 'opening up' of the Other. The experience of Nothingness within (and of) the world does not bring forth any 'concrete' forms of the Other. However, an  inexplicable, haunting, sensation lingers within, creating a suspicion, intensifying to the point of a “pushing”, for one to confront the Other by a  'clearing of the path', a renunciation of the distractions of the world, a pursuit and participation with the Nothingness. “since i will not die right away, nor regain my",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]******************

Regardless of the acendant  nature of the 'other half'(?) of the experience, this form is even still subsumed by the Nothing of the world.

Most 'spiritual' journeys consists of meditation, contemplation, various mortifications, and so on. Yet, even though these practices are performed with the aim of attaining a  mystical experience, most fail at ever achieving this end (at least in such an aweinspiring fashion). “In order to go into it, man must empty himself of all the finite contents of his ordinary life; he must surrender all preliminary concerns for the sake of the ultimate concern.

Like things in a five-and-ten.” And all this  shoddiness existed in a closed, cramped universe. “It’s as though one were below decks in a ship,” I said. “A five-and-ten-cent ship.” And as I looked, it became very clear that this five-and-ten-cent ship was in some way connected  with human pretensions, with the portrait of Cézanne, with A.B. among the Dolomites overacting his favorite character in fiction.

By means of this Nothing thou must die in thy self, many ways, at all times, and all hours, Keeping thy self in Nothing,  thou wilt bar the door against every thing that is not God”.

Most, of the seemingly rare few, who have experienced Nihilism do not have the 'stamina' to renounce the world in its entirety.

Heidegger himself attempts to avoid such presumptuous terms as 'atheistic' or 'theistic' as they are taken to be ultimately  restrictive for a full analysis of the human situation. What Heidegger speaks of  'objectively' must still be experienced subjectively. Therefore, Heidegger's analysis may only be seen as an introductory 'map' with regards to speaking  about the Other.

Without the need, yet, to go into detail concerning all of Heidegger's terms or concepts, a bare-bones laying out of the basic structure may be put down in order to help envision the coherency of Heidegger's analysis of human existence as a possible foundation for developing a language of Nihilism. Therefore, a very brief summary of what Heidegger refers to as 'Being-Towards-Death' with some of its particularities will be put forth as an example of the foundations of  such a language. 'Being-Towards-Death', concisely put, consist of anxiety, in a moment of vision, having a call of conscience that seems to come 'from me and beyond me' (Buber- “It appears simultaneously as acting on and as acted upon”), that 'gives something to be understood' in an 'indefinite', incommunicable way, and which causes the world to 'drop out' due everything  in it sinking into insignificant, yet which pushes",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]******************

Is Heidegger's, commonly labeled as 'atheistic', analysis really at all different from what the Trappist monk, Thomas Merton, has come to accept? Merton also clearly states the bankruptcy of a constant outward-seeking, hectic search for 'meaning' within life. In comparison to Heidegger, he express the same idea in this language: “The truly sacred attitude toward life is in no sense an escape  from the sense of nothingness that assails us when we are left alone with  ourselves. On the contrary, it penetrates into that darkness and that nothingness, realizing that the mercy of God has transformed our nothingness  into His temple and believing that in our darkness His light has hidden itself. Hence the sacred attitude is one which does not recoil from our own inner  emptiness, but rather penetrates it with awe and reverence, and with the awareness of mystery. This is a most",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: the_religious_experience_of_nihilism]]******************

A Nihilistic language would be one that attempts to reconcile such superficial disparities. With that said, Heidegger admits that his full conception of 'Being-TowardsDeath' is one that is 'fantastical'. That is to say, if we are to develop past a purely Heideggarian analysis of Being, how does one, in fact, proceed in a constant participation with an existence that is drowned in the meaninglessness of the  world and which faces annihilation at any moment? Is it possible to even proceed with, or in, such a 'fantastical' structure?

The fanaticism of thought that brews in the fear of Nihilism is only a turning away from Nihilism, an illusion of comfort; there is no embracing, there is no  participation in the Nothingness. The worldly religions are fundamentally  fanatical in nature due to their turning away of Nihilism. Spong, in his desire to 'revive' the dying language of Christianity, says: “We fear that if theism is  dismissed, only a bottomless pit remains.” and “Many forms of religion are little more than cultural manifestations of the fear of nothingness.

This is, of course, the precise opposite of the Nihilism we have examined here, where God is nothing and the world is all; that is a Nihilism that proceeds from the Abyss, and the Christian's is a ""Nihilism"" that proceeds from  abundance. The true Nihilist places his faith in things that pass away and end in nothing; all ""optimism"" on this foundation is clearly futile.” A relevant example of this sort of 'unthinking', or lack of search for Transcendence, can be shown within the mindset of a majority of practicing  scientists of today.

There is a similar criticism of 'unthinking' to be made against traditional 'religious' interpretations of the human condition.

These assumptions, as with many religious languages, are the reason why Heidegger proclaimed that a 'Christian philosophy' was the  equivalent of a 'round-square'. Heidegger's thought is that the religious languages that have so far been developed are restrictive of the human experience of the Other. In other words, religions with their theologies contain too many assumptions and 'answers' that shun the mystery of existence. Philosophy, on the other hand, the relentless 'Why?', is what is needed in order  to open up the mystery of Being, instead of closing it off and pushing it into a closet. One cannot turn the Other into the worldly, whether that attempt is through reason or myth.

It challenges the conventional understandings of nihilism found in mainstream philosophy, aiming to offer a new interpretation  that feels more authentic to the author's personal experience.  The writer emphasizes a non-traditional approach by extensively quoting from various thinkers without feeling the need to defend this method. The quotes are intended to show different perspectives converging towards a single, unified  insight into the experience of nihilism. The author expresses a desire for their own voice to be lost among these citations, implying that the message is more  significant than the messenger.  Part 2: The Nature of the Individual's Experience   The author delves",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************

The document reveals the intention to vary tones and potentially give the impression of multiple authors being involved, which reflects the multifaceted nature of the subject matter and the author's own internal conflicts and diversity  of thought.  Part 3: Philosophical Quotes and Their Role    The author continues to weave in quotes from different philosophers and thinkers, using their ideas to underscore the complexity of the human condition  and the struggle to find meaning. These quotes serve to illustrate the shared insights of various philosophers, suggesting an underlying unity in their  descriptions of existential experiences.  The inclusion of these quotes is meant to demonstrate that regardless of the diverse backgrounds or labels of the thinkers—whether they are Christian, Hindu, Nihilist, or otherwise—their",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"experiences and articulations of nihilism are fundamentally similar.  Part 4: The Author's Stance on Knowledge and Scholarly Work   The author criticizes traditional academia and the pursuit of 'scholarly' work, suggesting that the quest for knowledge or pride in one's intellectual accomplishments is misguided. They argue that true philosophy is an ongoing,  never-completed process of questioning and exploration, akin to a ""story"" rather than a concluded argument.

******************"   Part 5: Nihilism as Inescapable Truth   In this section, the author suggests that nihilism is the only 'truth' that can be universally experienced or 'known' by humans, as it does not offer answers but  rather represents the lack of them. The experience of nihilism is depicted as something that cuts through the fabric of all human convictions, revealing the  absence of ultimate knowledge or paths to follow. It is portrayed as unavoidable, inherent in every human life, whether acknowledged or not.  Part 6: Philosophical Quotes on Nihilism and Existence   The draH continues to interlace philosophical quotes that touch on topics like the fear of nothingness, the nature of anxiety, and the illusion of certainty and knowledge. These quotes further establish nihilism as an existential baseline—a  default state that underlies all human experience and thought. The philosophers cited seem to grapple with the same issues, despite the varied lexicons and  cultural contexts from which they",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************

Part 7: Critiques and Personal Reflections   The author anticipates criticisms of their work, acknowledging that because the experience of nihilism is rare, any critiques are likely to miss the mark. They assert their intention to report experiences without censorship, even if that  involves contradicting established views or themselves. The text implies that the author seeks no validation or approval for their thoughts, instead aligning  themselves with the quoted thinkers as equals in their confrontation with nihilism.

******************"   Part 8: Philosophical and Religious Vocations   A comparison is drawn between the calling of a poet and that of a priest, implying that true commitment to a calling—whether in art or religion—requires  something more profound than mere certification or examination. The author seems to question the authenticity of those who claim authority without the  profound personal experience to back it up.  Part 9: Conclusion and Acknowledgment of Nihilism's Complexity    The author concludes by reiterating the complexity of nihilism and its resistance to simplification. They express skepticism about the value of their own writing  and the act of writing in general, as well as a desire to make others uncomfortable and to challenge them to confront the abyss of existence. The  draft ends with the author positioning themselves as an observer of the absurdity of attempting to describe the indescribable.  The additional notes and quotes at the end of the draft suggest further development of",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"concepts discussed in the main text, such as reflections on the nature of despair, the concept of immortality, and the universal aspects of  nihilism. These notes seem to serve as a reservoir of ideas for expanding the main text.  Part 10: Immortality and the Afterlife   The author challenges traditional notions of immortality and the afterlife, arguing that seeking eternal life or heaven often reflects a naïve faith or a misunderstanding of the human condition. The document cites thinkers who ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   express skepticism about the coherence of the world and the plausibility of an afterlife that merely extends earthly experiences into infinity. Instead, the author implies that such immortality concepts fail to address the deeper existential  problems that nihilism exposes.  Part 11: Universal Experience of Nihilism    The author incorporates quotes that emphasize the universality of nihilism, suggesting that all people, knowingly or unknowingly, experience despair—a  central theme in nihilist thought. This despair is not tied to any particular life event or situation but is an inherent part of the human condition, a consequence  of our confrontation with existence itself.  Part 12: The Illusion of Simple Salvation    In the final portion of the notes, the idea of simple salvation is explored. The document questions the possibility of achieving an easy resolution to the  complex issues raised by nihilism, suggesting that such an attempt would be futile. The author returns to",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************

Part 13: The Individual's Search for Meaning    The document culminates by encouraging an individual approach to religion and philosophy, one where personal insights remain private and sacred. The author  stresses the importance of seeking one's own understanding rather than blindly following established doctrines. This pursuit of personal meaning is juxtaposed ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   with the societal pressure to conform and the disillusionment that can arise when acknowledging the depth of existential despair.  Conclusion   Overall, the document presents a deep dive into nihilism, as both a philosophical concept and a personal experience. It is rich with quotes and reflections that  span centuries and cultures, yet coalesce around the central theme of meaninglessness. The author's writing is both an exploration and a confession, a  testament of the struggle between the desire for truth and the acceptance of the intrinsic unknowability inherent to human existence. It is not so much a  systematic study but more a narrative journey through the various landscapes of nihilist thought.

Philosophy and Life's Significance: The text opens by questioning the significance of life and philosophical inquiry. It references Cicero's belief that philosophy prepares one for death and Heidegger's thoughts on being struck by the  strangeness of existence, which leads to the fundamental ""Why?"" of life.  Human Activity and Meaninglessness: The idea that human actions are ultimately meaningless is presented. The text suggests that much of what drives human behavior—our goals and distractions—are rooted in an ignorance of nihilism. The  breakdown of these distractions can force one to confront nihilism directly, raising questions about the rationality of suicide, the possibility of living with a  sense of Nothingness, and the potential for a religious experience or philosophy that can incorporate this sense of nothing.

The Scholar's Dilemma: There is a portrayal of scholars as people who can't think independently but merely react to pre-existing thoughts, echoing Nietzsche's criticism of academia.

Religious Philosophy and Its Shortcomings: Religious philosophers are criticized for offering weak defenses of their beliefs and for not engaging deeply enough with skepticism. This is linked to the notion that philosophy has strayed from its  Socratic roots, which were more inquisitive and less concerned with providing definite answers.  Part 3: Existential Conditions and Philosophy's Potential Existential Disillusionment: The text discusses how, when the veneer of life's immediate concerns is stripped away, individuals may confront a profound sense of disillusionment and the   meaninglessness of their achievements in the face of death and the vastness of time.  Philosophy's Limitations and",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"Death: The draft continues to argue that philosophy, in its traditional form, cannot fully address the human confrontation with death. It suggests that most philosophies dodge the issue of mortality and  fail to acknowledge the transformative impact of facing one's finitude.  Philosophy as Interpretation: The author posits that philosophy should not be seen as a provider of definitive truths but rather as a method to interpret and explain existence. This interpretation leads to the conclusion that philosophy ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   should aim to create a 'map of consequences' derived from the direct human experience of nihilism.  Confronting the Void of Existence: A significant portion of the document focuses on the existential experience of facing the 'Nothing'—the realization that life may have no inherent meaning. This encounter with nothingness is described as a  transformative, albeit rare, event that can shake an individual's worldview to its core.  Part 4: Addressing the Experience of Nihilism Constructive Content of Nihilism: The draH explores whether within the desolate landscape of nihilism, there might be a kernel of constructive content—a 'message' or a transformative insight— despite its fundamentally destructive  nature. It ponders the possibility of interpreting this experience in a way that isn't purely negative.

Part 5: Nihilism and Transcendence  Transcendence and Nihilism: The text posits that experiences of nihilism, with their deconstructive qualities, may actually lay the groundwork for  transcendence—a state of being that goes beyond the physical or material aspects of life. This state is not necessarily religious in the traditional sense but is  an acknowledgment of something that is ""Wholly-Other.""  Naturalism vs. Transcendental Interpretations: The author contrasts naturalistic interpretations, which ground human experience and understanding in  materialism and science, with transcendental ones that suggest there may be more to human existence than what's observable or measurable.

It posits that even though nihilism is a universal undercurrent, the direct  and transformative experience of it is rare.  Part 6: Implications and Paths Forward  The Rarity of Nihilistic Experiences: The text suggests that the reason full encounters with nihilism are rare is due to an instinctual or conscious inclination to engage with the world. This engagement masks the underlying nothingness,  allowing individuals to feel they are living meaningful lives despite the potential absence of intrinsic meaning.  Madness, Suicide, and the Other: The author then touches on the potential outcomes of facing nihilism: madness, suicide, or a turn towards the Other (which could represent a form of transcendence or ultimate reality).

Philosophy's Limitations and Contributions: Philosophy is seen as having the potential to contribute to understanding nihilism if it can move beyond  traditional frameworks and engage directly with human experiences of nothingness. The document argues for a philosophy rooted in the lived  experience rather than abstract theorization.  The Struggle with Nothingness: The draH considers the struggle with nothingness as a defining aspect of human existence. It weighs the possibility that this ,[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   struggle may contain a hidden message or revelation that could reshape one's understanding of life.  The Inevitability of Nihilism: Finally, the document contends that there is no ultimate escape from nihilism; it is an ever-present reality beneath the surface of existence. It challenges readers to consider how one might authentically engage  with this reality and potentially find a path through it that does not lead to despair.  --- Summary:  The Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism   -Awaken, Material Nightmare- Part 1: Introduction and the Philosophical Dilemma  Your document begins with an exploration of the struggle between traditional religious belief and a modern understanding that might exclude the presence of a divine entity or ultimate reality.

This turning away is likened to an ""always falling"" condition, tied to Western and Christian cultural constructs such as  'original sin' or scientific reductions of consciousness to mere accidents. This results in a ""divided-self"" where one is torn between engaging with the  finite, material world and the pursuit of something infinite or transcendent.   This divided-self is depicted as inescapable and pervasive, influencing how people react to the world and their place within it. Through various philosophical and religious quotes, the draH illustrates the inner conflict that  arises from this condition. The implication is that most people settle for superficial solutions to this conflict, avoiding genuine engagement with the  philosophical and existential questions that arise from this divided state of being.

It's argued that despite moments of clarity, existence tends to dominate us with its mundane demands, leading to a life of distraction  rather than true engagement with our ""authentic self."" The text posits that the mundane life is one of inauthenticity, a sort of patchwork  existence that covers up the underlying despair and meaninglessness.

This renunciation is not an intellectual exercise but a lived experience of turning away from the world— a common thread in many mystical traditions, like those of Christianity,  Buddhism, and Taoism. The discussion highlights the struggle between the worldly and the spiritual.  Part 3: The Allure of Naturalism and the Experience of Guilt  The draH delves into the tension between naturalism—the focus on the material and finite world—and the pull toward something beyond this, a Transcendent aspect of reality. The writers cited in your document describe  humanity's recurrent fall back into the concerns of the finite world, a condition that oHen leaves people with a sense of guilt. This guilt isn't  necessarily about failing others but is an internal struggle, a frustration with one's inability to live authentically or to realize a ""True Self"" that is more  than just the sum of naturalistic impulses.   Heidegger is referenced to articulate a",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************

Guilt, in this sense, is not about social or moral failings but about  the failure to recognize and actualize our deepest potentialities.  Part 4: The Human Condition and Renunciation of the World   The text moves on to discuss the idea of renunciation as a response to the divided nature of human consciousness. It suggests that only those who  have seen the illusory nature of material concerns and worldly attachments ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   can truly grasp the human condition. This understanding oHen leads to a negative or non-action-oriented approach to life, where the focus shiHs from external actions to internal realization.  Various religious and philosophical figures are cited to support this idea, including Vivekananda, who criticizes the materialistic interpretation of action- oriented religion. The draH also brings in Luther and other thinkers to emphasize the point that true faith and spirituality may involve a fundamental detachment  from the world and its transient concerns.  Part 5: Nihilism, Indifference, and Participation   The document further explores the concept of Nihilism and how it represents an ultimate confrontation with the meaninglessness of existence.  Rather than proposing solutions, Nihilism compels individuals to face the abyss, leading to either indifference or a radical form of participation that  grapples with the void itself.

Part 6: Worldly Meaning vs. Transcendental Significance  As the draH continues, it contrasts the overwhelming draw of worldly meaning with the potential for a Transcendental perspective.

The text references thinkers like Huxley, who critique the modern tendency to place undue importance on progress and human achievement, suggesting that this perspective leads to a distorted understanding of reality. The  argument unfolds around the idea that true liberation from the horrors of existence comes not from the attachment to worldly concerns but from a  profound realization of the world's unreality.  Part 7: The Problem of Inauthentic Living and the Role of Nihilism   The draH posits that many people live inauthentically, ignoring the despair and meaninglessness that underpin human existence. Nihilism is seen as a  destructive force that cannot be easily reconciled with a return to normal life once it has been fully realized; the world becomes transparent and dead to  those who experience it.

Instead, the draH argues for an empirical engagement with the phenomena of existence, like  uncanniness and mystical experiences, to open up a different level of understanding that goes beyond intellectual theorizing.   Throughout, the draH emphasizes the need for a philosophical approach that remains open to the questions and mysteries inherent in being human. By  comparing the casual acceptance of existence to the profound sense of ""cosmic panic"" that some argue is central to the human experience, the  draH indicates that a truly philosophical outlook must grapple with the absurdity",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************

Part 9: The Role of Doubt and Skepticism   In exploring the depths of doubt and skepticism, the draH highlights how they are not only integral to the experience of Nihilism but can also serve as  a pathway to a more profound understanding of existence. It acknowledges that while mystical and transcendent experiences may offer a glimpse into a  larger reality, they too are ultimately insufficient in the face of the inexorable pull of meaninglessness.

The draH questions whether this proposed courage is a genuine confrontation with Nihilism or a means of retreating from it. The  text suggests that true courage might lie not in facing the world but in acknowledging the futility of doing so.   The draH concludes by suggesting that the existential challenge is not to find meaning or happiness within the world but to confront the reality of its  absence. It offers a somber perspective that sees the human condition as one of inevitable disillusionment with the world and a constant struggle to  make sense of a life that is ultimately without inherent purpose or value.

******************"   -The Suicide of the Renouncer- Part 1: Introduction to Nihilism  The essay begins by examining the concept of Nihilism and its impact on human consciousness and behavior. Nihilism is essentially the belief in the absence of inherent meaning in life. The author quotes a variety of thinkers  who have touched upon existential themes, from the despair and madness that can arise from a deep understanding of human existence to the  potential healing that such an understanding might also bring.   The central question posed is whether the full acknowledgement of Nihilism necessarily leads to madness or suicide, or if it can be a path to a different kind of transcendence. The author suggests that while Nihilism can be  distinguished from mental illness, it can still lead to profound psychological distress. This distress manifests as a confrontation with the void, or the  nothingness, that underlies the façade of everyday life.  Part 2: Madness, Suicide, and Their Relation to Nihilism  The",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"essay proceeds to explore how madness and suicide relate to Nihilism. It questions whether these are inevitable outcomes for those who deeply internalize a nihilistic worldview. The writing delves into historical and  philosophical figures who have grappled with the despair of Nihilism, and whether or not madness is a state to be embraced as a form of deeper  insight or rejected as a destructive end. ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"    A specific case is mentioned – that of Mitchell Heisman, a man who committed suicide aHer writing a 2,000-page manifesto on Nihilism. His act is used to illustrate the potential extremes of a nihilistic perspective, raising  the question of whether there can be a rational justification for suicide in a world perceived as inherently irrational.  Part 3: The Search for Authenticity in Nihilism  The essay then confronts the topic of authenticity, particularly in the context of suicide. It differentiates between what might be considered ""worldly"" suicide, driven by loss or failure in life's pursuits, and ""nihilistic"" suicide,  which stems from a deep engagement with the existential realization of life's meaninglessness.   The author debates whether the nihilistic suicide could be seen as more 'authentic' because it is not an escape but a deliberate choice that aligns  with a certain logical consistency when one has fully embraced the void. The worldly suicide, by contrast, might be",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"seen as an attempt to flee from a temporary disruption in an otherwise perceived 'good' life.  Part 4: The Possibility of a Nihilistic Language of Transcendence  The essay moves to consider whether a language or symbolism could be developed that acknowledges the experience of Nihilism while offering a form of transcendence. It questions whether such a language could  transform the despair of Nihilism into a spiritual journey, akin to the experiences of saints or mystics, without negating the nihilistic insights into  the absurdity of existence. ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"    The concept of an ""authentic"" suicide is further analyzed, in which the individual has moved beyond worldly attachments and sees no value in continued existence. This is contrasted with the person who commits suicide  due to a loss that disrupts their place in the world. The essay suggests that a person who has fully embraced Nihilism may see suicide as a logical and  even   ""authentic"" release into the divine or as a final affirmation of their worldview.  Part 5: The Logic of Suicide versus The Logic of Life   The essay then juxtaposes the logic of suicide with the logic of life, noting that those who subscribe to the logic of life find it inconceivable to  understand the reasoning behind a nihilistic suicide. The majority of people, according to the essay, are immersed in the ""logic of life,"" which involves a  commitment to find meaning in everyday existence and activities.   It's also mentioned that individuals who have encountered the ""Nothing"" of the world cannot fully convey",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"the profundity of their experience to those  who haven't questioned or recognized life's inherent meaninglessness.  Part 6: The Role of Thinking, Madness, and the Divine in Nihilism   The essay discusses the potential of embracing madness as an ideal, in the sense that it can lead to a profound religious or spiritual experience. It  suggests that the terror and the allure of madness might be akin to encountering the divine or the ""Other"" in Nihilism. The writer reflects on ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   how challenging and demanding deep thought can be, and how madness may be a form of ultimate liberation or exploration.  Part 7: The Dichotomy of Public Perception and Personal Experience   Lastly, the essay acknowledges the dichotomy between how society views those who pursue a path of Nihilism and how these individuals perceive  themselves. Society oHen labels them as mad or depressed, while they might see themselves as having a more sincere or deeper grasp of reality.  The author points out the irony of society's acceptance of trivial pursuits while mocking or misunderstanding the search.  Part 8: The Uncomfortable Reality of Nihilism and the Potential for Transcendence   The writer contemplates why the embrace of Nihilism oHen makes others uncomfortable and why thinking deeply about existence can lead to  skepticism, despair, and the confrontation with Nihilism. The possibility of finding something divine in the feeling of meaninglessness is pondered — suggesting that such",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************

******************"   Part 9: The Varied Responses to the Realization of Life's Absurdity  Different responses to the realization of life's absurdity are explored. For some, the awareness can lead to an obsessive engagement with the  meaninglessness, rejecting all distractions. For others, this realization might be a cause for despair and a temptation towards suicide. The essay probes  whether there's a ""correct"" response to Nihilism, whether it's suicide, faith, or some form of transcendence.  Part 10: Distinguishing between Types of Suicide and Their Underlying Motivations   The text distinguishes between types of suicide, suggesting that some may result from a retreat from worldly failure and others from a deeper nihilistic  realization. The question is raised whether the motivation behind a suicide could affect its meaning or authenticity, and whether those who have not  lost all worldly attachments can be pulled back from the brink.

It ponders the value of suicide in the face of Nihilism  and whether it represents a rational and authentic response to the understanding that life is intrinsically void of meaning.   Throughout the essay, the author reflects on the complex nature of suicide, the role of individual experiences in shaping one's response to Nihilism, and ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   the possibility of finding some form of redemption or purpose through an embrace of the void.  Part 12: Insights and Perspectives from Various Thinkers   The essay's extra notes and quotes section provides additional context and scholarly support for the main themes, providing a wealth of insights from  various philosophers, mystics, and writers who have addressed the themes of Nihilism, madness, and transcendence. These figures, ranging from  Vivekananda to Kierkegaard, offer diverse perspectives on the desire to transcend the mundane and embrace a more profound, oHen religious or  spiritual, understanding of existence.  Vivekananda, for example, speaks of the yearning to become 'Godintoxicated,' which reflects a passionate pursuit of divine madness over mundane rationality. These sentiments echo the earlier discussion in the essay on the potential of  Nihilism to lead not just to despair but also to a kind of ecstatic truth.

******************"   Part 14: The Role of Suffering and Solitude in Spiritual Awakening  The authors cited in the extra notes suggest that suffering and solitude can play significant roles in spiritual awakening. They propose that through  confronting the darkest aspects of life — such as death and meaninglessness — one can achieve a clearer vision of reality. This process can lead to a deep  sense of liberation from societal expectations and a closer engagement with existential truths.  Part 15: The Contrast Between Natural Life and Spiritual Death  The essay emphasizes the contrast between what is considered   'natural life' — the pursuit of happiness and avoidance of suffering — and 'spiritual death,' where one comes to terms with the ultimate  meaninglessness of such pursuits. There's a recognition that the understanding of true despair or the 'sickness unto death,' as Kierkegaard  calls it, is beyond the comprehension of the 'natural man.'

The philosophers and writers cited suggest that through this process, one may arrive at a state of being that is  fundamentally at odds with societal norms, which oHen value superficial distractions over deep contemplation.  Part 18: Societal Misunderstanding of the Nihilistic Journey  Society's discomfort with the nihilistic journey is further examined, as those who seek meaning beyond conventional understandings oHen face ridicule or are deemed unwell. The thinkers highlighted in the notes argue that the  societal impulse to 'cure' or 'correct' those who reject life's superficial pleasures is misguided and fails to recognize the legitimacy and potential  depth of their existential crisis.

This inner conflict is seen as an essential part of the human condition and a driving force behind the quest for understanding and  meaning.  Part 21: Conclusion and the Question of Suicide   The essay concludes with a contemplation on the question of suicide within the context of Nihilism. It challenges readers to consider whether suicide, in  response to the realization of life's absurdity, might be a rational act or whether it represents a failure to find a more profound response to the void.  The text leaves open the question of whether an alternative, more transcendental language of Nihilism could offer a meaningful path forward  for those who grapple with these existential dilemmas.

The writer grapples with the impacts of this perspective on human life and thought, questioning the point  of human endeavors, the legitimacy of suicide, and whether a philosophy or religion can be built on the foundation of nihilism. The text seeks to  establish whether nihilism possesses any constructive elements that could be interpreted as a form of religious experience or whether it is merely a  destructive force.  Part 2: Nihilism's Challenge to Philosophy and Religion  The writer criticizes modern philosophy, particularly within American universities, as being detached from existential concerns, reduced to intellectual exercises akin to puzzles.

This avoidance comes in many forms, from the mundane to the intellectual, and is seen as a distraction from confronting  nihilism directly. The writer posits that genuine engagement with nihilism is rare and that most philosophical and religious pursuits fail to address it  wholly and are thereby fundamentally misguided.  Part 4: The Experience of Nihilism   The writer emphasizes that to truly understand nihilism, one must directly experience its profound sense of nothingness. It is through this encounter  that the full weight of life's meaninglessness is felt—not as a subjective value judgment but as an objective realization.

Part 6: The Possibility of Constructive Nihilism   The writer asks whether nihilism can have any constructive implications. Can the experience of nihilism, with its deep sense of boredom, anxiety, and  despair, offer any message or guidance? Is there something beyond the destruction and emptiness that nihilism brings? The text seeks to explore  these questions while maintaining a critical stance on the typical answers provided by both religious and secular philosophies.  Part 7: Nihilism's Relation to Transcendence and Religion  The draH discusses the concept of ""Transcendence"" as an alternative to ""religious"" experiences, suggesting that nihilism may not only be a deconstructive force but could also lead to a form of transcendence—a  wholly Other aspect of human experience.

Part 9: The Paradox of Subjective Meaning in an Objective   Nihilistic Universe  The writer contemplates the paradox of finding subjective meaning in a universe that is objectively meaningless according to nihilism. They examine the human tendency to attach significance to personal experiences, efforts,  and achievements, despite their eventual disappearance and lack of enduring impact in the vastness of cosmic time—the so-called 'deep time'.  This subjective sense of meaning is seen as a psychological or intellectual defense against the stark reality of existential nullity.

Part 12: The Potential of a Philosophy or Language of   Nihilism  Finally, the draft proposes the challenge of developing a philosophy or language that stems from the direct experience of nihilism. The writer recognizes the need for a framework that acknowledges the destructive  aspects of nihilism but also explores its potential for constructive content, even if it might ultimately be illusory. The possibility of nihilism leading to  madness, suicide, or a transcendent Other is considered, leaving open the question of what lies beyond the experience of meaninglessness.

******************"   The Symbolic Resonance of Nothing -The Dialectical Silence- Overview The draft is a philosophical exploration of Nihilism and its implications for language, existence, and the human condition. The writer investigates whether it's possible to develop a language that authentically engages with the concept of  Nihilism—a worldview that sees life and the universe as lacking inherent meaning or value. The document contemplates how such a language can  navigate the ""Nothing"" that Nihilism proposes while also allowing for the possibility of transcending this meaninglessness.  The author references various philosophers and thinkers, such as Martin Heidegger, to discuss the challenges of facing the abyss of human consciousness  and the ultimate reality—or lack thereof.   Central to the discussion are questions about the role of philosophical thinking vis-à-vis Nihilism, the potential for a Nihilistic language to express and confront  the ""Nothing,"" and the human mind's ability to grapple",[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************

Part 1: The Dilemma of Language and Nihilism  The writer begins by addressing the inadequacy of language when it comes to discussing Nihilism. They argue that clichés and ""idle talk"" fail to capture ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   the depth and implications of a Nihilistic perspective, suggesting that traditional expressions are insufficient to convey the true experience of Nihilism, which is characterized by its non-transferable nature.  Part 2: The Human Condition and Nihilism  The draft delves into the human tendency to seek meaning and security in the face of a potentially meaningless existence. It questions whether humans can authentically confront Nihilism without succumbing to self- deception or escaping into comforting illusions. The author examines the possibility of ""Being-towards-death,"" as described by Heidegger, and  whether humans can embrace this existential standpoint.  Part 3: Heidegger's Influence and Language Development   Heidegger's concepts are presented as the foundation for developing a language of Nihilism, with terms such as ""anxiety,"" ""authenticity,"" and  ""Being-Towards-Death"" providing insights into the human condition that could pave the way for a Nihilistic language. However,",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************

This language is meant to be symbolic and self-critical, ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   always open for reinterpretation. The intention is not to provide comfort from the Nothingness but to confront it and allow for a genuine encounter with the terror of existence.  Part 5: The Challenge of Describing Nihilistic Experience  The writer acknowledges the difficulty in finding words that adequately capture the Nihilistic experience. They cite St. Therese of Lisieux's struggle to articulate her spiritual darkness within a Christian framework as an example  of the challenges inherent in conveying deeply personal and transformative experiences.  Part 6: The Role of Silence and Renunciation  The draft suggests that those who have truly encountered Nihilism may be left with no choice but to embrace a silent acknowledgment of their condition. However, it also points out that few are willing to completely  renounce the world, underscoring that experiencing Nothing and renouncing everything are not the same.  Part 7: Affirmative Aspects of Nihilism   The author explores whether",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"there is something affirmative within the experience of Nihilism that can be used to develop a language capable of  acknowledging and transcending worldly suffering.

",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   Part 8: The Need for a New Language  The need for a language that addresses Nihilism is tied to the human desire to confront rather than replace the Transcendental yearning that Nihilism  evokes. The writer quotes Aldous Huxley on the limitations of conventional theology and the necessity for a language that can be comprehended only  by those who have transcended ordinary, unregenerate experiences.  Part 9: Heidegger's Terms as a Foundation   Using Heidegger's framework, the draft outlines the basic structure of a potential language of Nihilism, focusing on the concept of ""Being-Towards- Death."" This concept involves experiencing anxiety in a profound moment that calls the individual to understand something incommunicable, leading  to a sense of insignificance in the world and a push towards authenticity.  Part 10: Heidegger vs. Religious Perspectives   The author compares Heidegger's notion of ""Being-TowardsDeath"" with the views of Trappist monk Thomas Merton, who also",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"acknowledges the emptiness of constant outward seeking. The comparison raises the question  of whether the language of Nihilism could bridge the gap between the atheistic overtones oHen ascribed to Heidegger's philosophy and the theistic  language used by Merton.

******************"   interpretations. They express skepticism about traditional religious approaches that offer answers rather than embracing the mystery of existence, which is seen as a form of idolatry.  Part 12: The Futile Optimism and Scientific Realism  The draft criticizes the 'optimistic' outlook prevalent in American culture and certain scientific circles, where empirical reality is regarded as the ultimate truth without questioning the underlying reasons for existence. The author  argues that this 'optimistic scientism' is a form of 'unthinking' that fails to acknowledge the deeper philosophical questions.     Part 13: The Rejection of Traditional Religious  Interpretations  The writer takes issue with traditional religious interpretations of the human condition, which oHen rely on unexamined theological assumptions, rituals, and dogmas. By contrast, the proposed language of Nihilism would  focus on the relentless inquiry into the nature of Being rather than providing pre-packaged answers ",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"Part 14: Conclusion and Further Exploration  In summary, the writer advocates for a language of Nihilism that would serve as a map through the Nothingness of the world without claiming to offer ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   'truth'. This language should be filled with doubt, continually asking ""Why?"" and preparing the individual for the possibility of transcendence. The draft concludes with an invitation to further explore the tensions between the  experience of Nihilism and the development of a language that can genuinely reflect it.  Part 15: Extra Notes and Quotes  An assortment of additional thoughts and quotes from Heidegger and other thinkers are provided, which the author plans to incorporate into a more polished piece. These notes reflect the ongoing struggle to articulate a  coherent response to Nihilism and suggest the shape that a future language might take.   The writer ends with a reflection on the non-transferability of the Nihilistic experience and the paradox of developing a language for something that  inherently resists articulation. This contradiction is acknowledged with a degree of irony, suggesting that the very act of trying to create a language for Nihilism may be inherently",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"flawed or futile.  Part 16: The Universality and Rarity of Nihilism  The draft touches on the universality of the Nihilistic experience, which, while being a fundamental aspect of being human, is rarely confronted directly due to its challenging and unsettling nature. The writer asks why this  experience is so infrequently and fully embraced, positing that the difficulty lies in the intensity and profundity of fully realizing Nihilism. ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   Part 17: Final Thoughts on Nihilistic Language  In the concluding thoughts, the author grapples with the purpose and potential utility of a Nihilistic language. They ponder whether such a  language serves as a guide through the Nothingness of the world, facilitating a push towards transcendence, or whether it's merely replacing traditional  religious rituals with another form of structure. The language of Nihilism is envisioned as a tentative and doubting map, constantly questioning and  open to reinterpretation, rather than as a doctrine offering certainty and closure.  Part 18: Reflections on Quietism and Solitude  The draft ends with reflections on the relationship between the proposed language and concepts like quietism and solitude. Given that idle talk and distraction are seen as barriers to confronting Nihilism, the language of  Nihilism might necessitate solitude and silence as conditions for its development and understanding.

******************" Exploration of Nihilism:&nbsp;The document delves into nihilism, a philosophical concept that suggests life, values, and the universe inherently lack meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. It grapples with the implications of embracing a nihilistic viewpoint and how it affects our understanding of existence.",[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Philosophy and Life's Significance:&nbsp;The text opens by questioning the significance of life and philosophical inquiry.

******************" Human Activity and Meaninglessness:&nbsp;The idea that human actions are ultimately meaningless is presented. The text suggests that much of what drives human behavior—our goals and distractions—are rooted in an ignorance of nihilism. The breakdown of these distractions can force one to confront nihilism directly, raising questions about the rationality of suicide, the possibility of living with a sense of Nothingness, and the potential for a religious experience or philosophy that can incorporate this sense of nothing.",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Part 2: Philosophy's Role and Limitations,[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Critique of Academic Philosophy:&nbsp;The draft criticizes contemporary academic philosophy, particularly the American university approach, as having become a sterile intellectual exercise akin to solving a puzzle, disconnected from existential concerns. It argues that philosophy has lost touch with the profound questions of existence due to an overemphasis on analytic reasoning.",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The Scholar's Dilemma:&nbsp;There is a portrayal of scholars as people who can't think independently but merely react to pre-existing thoughts, echoing Nietzsche's criticism of academia.

******************" Atheism and the Problem of Evil:&nbsp;The document challenges atheist philosophers on the grounds that their rejection of God and reliance on human reason lack a non-pragmatic basis in a naturalistic worldview, questioning why reason should be valued over absurdity in a purposeless universe.",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Religious Philosophy and Its Shortcomings:&nbsp;Religious philosophers are criticized for offering weak defenses of their beliefs and for not engaging deeply enough with skepticism. This is linked to the notion that philosophy has strayed from its Socratic roots, which were more inquisitive and less concerned with providing definite answers. Part 3: Existential Conditions and Philosophy's Potential",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Existential Disillusionment:&nbsp;The text discusses how, when the veneer of life's immediate concerns is stripped away, individuals may confront a profound sense of disillusionment and the meaninglessness of their achievements in the face of death and the vastness of time.",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Philosophy's Limitations and Death:&nbsp;The draft continues to argue that philosophy, in its traditional form, cannot fully address the human confrontation with death. It suggests that most philosophies dodge the issue of mortality and fail to acknowledge the transformative impact of facing one's finitude.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Philosophy as Interpretation:&nbsp;The author posits that philosophy should not be seen as a provider of definitive truths but rather as a method to interpret and explain existence. This interpretation leads to the conclusion that philosophy should aim to create a 'map of consequences' derived from the direct human experience of nihilism.,[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Confronting the Void of Existence:&nbsp;A significant portion of the document focuses on the existential experience of facing the 'Nothing'—the realization that life may have no inherent meaning.

 ******************Re-defining 'Religious' Experience:&nbsp;The text calls for a redefinition or avoidance of the term 'religious' due to its various connotations and instead suggests using 'Transcendence' to describe experiences that reach beyond mundane existence.,[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Part 5: Nihilism and Transcendence,[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Transcendence and Nihilism:&nbsp;The text posits that experiences of nihilism, with their deconstructive qualities, may actually lay the groundwork for transcendence—a state of being that goes beyond the physical or material aspects of life.

******************" Rarity of Nihilism's Experience:&nbsp;The text reflects on how the everyday distractions and engagements of life often prevent people from confronting the full weight of nihilism.

 ******************Part 6: Implications and Paths Forward,[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The Rarity of Nihilistic Experiences:&nbsp;The text suggests that the reason full encounters with nihilism are rare is due to an instinctual or conscious inclination to engage with the world. This engagement masks the underlying nothingness, allowing individuals to feel they are living meaningful lives despite the potential absence of intrinsic meaning.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Madness, Suicide, and the Other:&nbsp;The author then touches on the potential outcomes of facing nihilism: madness, suicide, or a turn towards the Other (which could represent a form of transcendence or ultimate reality). The relationship between these responses is considered, questioning whether they are mutually exclusive or intrinsically linked.",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Philosophy's Limitations and Contributions:&nbsp;Philosophy is seen as having the potential to contribute to understanding nihilism if it can move beyond traditional frameworks and engage directly with human experiences of nothingness. The document argues for a philosophy rooted in the lived experience rather than abstract theorization.,[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************The Struggle with Nothingness:&nbsp;The draft considers the struggle with nothingness as a defining aspect of human existence. It weighs the possibility that this struggle may contain a hidden message or revelation that could reshape one's understanding of life.,[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The Inevitability of Nihilism:&nbsp;Finally, the document contends that there is no ultimate escape from nihilism; it is an ever-present reality beneath the surface of existence. It challenges readers to consider how one might authentically engage with this reality and potentially find a path through it that does not lead to despair.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************--- Summary of The Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism Part 1: Introduction and the Philosophical Dilemma,[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Your document begins with an exploration of the struggle between traditional religious belief and a modern understanding that might exclude the presence of a divine entity or ultimate reality. The opening quotes from Spong, Sartre, and Vivekananda set the stage for a discussion on the challenges that contemporary individuals face when reconciling their spiritual beliefs with a scientific and practical worldview.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The text suggests that many people have come to the brink of what's described as a Nihilistic experience—a profound sense of the meaningless or absurdity of life—but instead of confronting it, they turn away and distract themselves with various activities. This turning away is likened to an ""always falling"" condition, tied to Western and Christian cultural constructs such as 'original sin' or scientific reductions of consciousness to mere accidents. This results in a ""divided-self"" where one is torn between engaging with the finite, material world and the pursuit of something infinite or transcendent.",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" This divided-self is depicted as inescapable and pervasive, influencing how people react to the world and their place within it. Through various philosophical and religious quotes, the draft illustrates the inner conflict that arises from this condition. The implication is that most people settle for superficial solutions to this conflict, avoiding genuine engagement with the philosophical and existential questions that arise from this divided state of being.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Part 2: The Nature of Despair and Religious Perspectives,[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The document continues with a deeper look into despair and the human condition through the eyes of existential thinkers like Kierkegaard and Heidegger. It's argued that despite moments of clarity, existence tends to dominate us with its mundane demands, leading to a life of distraction rather than true engagement with our ""authentic self."" The text posits that the mundane life is one of inauthenticity, a sort of patchwork existence that covers up the underlying despair and meaninglessness.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Several religious perspectives are brought into the conversation, suggesting that genuine religiosity involves a profound dissatisfaction with the world and a renunciation of its superficialities. This renunciation is not an intellectual exercise but a lived experience of turning away from the world—a common thread in many mystical traditions, like those of Christianity, Buddhism, and Taoism. The discussion highlights the struggle between the worldly and the spiritual.",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Part 3: The Allure of Naturalism and the Experience of Guilt,[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The draft delves into the tension between naturalism—the focus on the material and finite world—and the pull toward something beyond this, a Transcendent aspect of reality. The writers cited in your document describe humanity's recurrent fall back into the concerns of the finite world, a condition that often leaves people with a sense of guilt. This guilt isn't necessarily about failing others but is an internal struggle, a frustration with one's inability to live authentically or to realize a ""True Self"" that is more than just the sum of naturalistic impulses.",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Heidegger is referenced to articulate a more existential understanding of guilt, one that is an essential part of being and arising from our natural tendency to be absorbed by the world rather than being authentically ourselves. Guilt, in this sense, is not about social or moral failings but about the failure to recognize and actualize our deepest potentialities.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Part 4: The Human Condition and Renunciation of the World,[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The text moves on to discuss the idea of renunciation as a response to the divided nature of human consciousness. It suggests that only those who have seen the illusory nature of material concerns and worldly attachments can truly grasp the human condition. This understanding often leads to a negative or non-action-oriented approach to life, where the focus shifts from external actions to internal realization.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Various religious and philosophical figures are cited to support this idea, including Vivekananda, who criticizes the materialistic interpretation of action-oriented religion. The draft also brings in Luther and other thinkers to emphasize the point that true faith and spirituality may involve a fundamental detachment from the world and its transient concerns.",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Part 5: Nihilism, Indifference, and Participation",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The document further explores the concept of Nihilism and how it represents an ultimate confrontation with the meaninglessness of existence. Rather than proposing solutions, Nihilism compels individuals to face the abyss, leading to either indifference or a radical form of participation that grapples with the void itself. This section debates whether the act of participating in life, with its inherent lack of ultimate meaning, offers any genuine value.",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Part 6: Worldly Meaning vs. Transcendental Significance,[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" As the draft continues, it contrasts the overwhelming draw of worldly meaning with the potential for a Transcendental perspective. The seductive nature of assigning importance to everyday life and its activities is depicted as a cancerous illusion, one that obstructs a clear view of the inherent lack of meaning in the world. This section scrutinizes the human tendency to find solace in personal relationships, achievements, and societal progress, suggesting that these are merely distractions from the harsh reality of existence.",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The text references thinkers like Huxley, who critique the modern tendency to place undue importance on progress and human achievement, suggesting that this perspective leads to a distorted understanding of reality. The argument unfolds around the idea that true liberation from the horrors of existence comes not from the attachment to worldly concerns but from a profound realization of the world's unreality.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Part 7: The Problem of Inauthentic Living and the Role of Nihilism,[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The draft posits that many people live inauthentically, ignoring the despair and meaninglessness that underpin human existence. Nihilism is seen as a destructive force that cannot be easily reconciled with a return to normal life once it has been fully realized; the world becomes transparent and dead to those who experience it.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The text concludes with a reflection on the function of Nihilism in pushing individuals beyond superficial engagements with the world. It challenges the reader to consider why anyone would want to participate in Nihilism, suggesting that it is not an end in itself but a means to confront and perhaps transcend the limitations of existence.",[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Part 8: Reflections on Science, Religion, Unthinking, and the Human Predicament",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Finally, the draft examines the shortcomings of both the scientific and religious communities in addressing the profound questions of existence. It criticizes the scientific focus on describing reality without asking the deeper ""why"" behind it and the religious tendency to offer pre-packaged answers rather than embracing the mystery of being.",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Philosophers are not spared from this critique. The document suggests that many philosophers lack a direct experience of the issues they discuss and therefore fall short of offering meaningful insights. Instead, the draft argues for an empirical engagement with the phenomena of existence, like uncanniness and mystical experiences, to open up a different level of understanding that goes beyond intellectual theorizing.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Throughout, the draft emphasizes the need for a philosophical approach that remains open to the questions and mysteries inherent in being human. By comparing the casual acceptance of existence to the profound sense of ""cosmic panic"" that some argue is central to the human experience, the draft indicates that a truly philosophical outlook must grapple with the absurdity and uncanniness of life. Part 9: The Role of Doubt and Skepticism In exploring the depths of doubt and skepticism, the draft highlights how they are not only integral to the experience of Nihilism but can also serve as a pathway to a more profound understanding of existence. It acknowledges that while mystical and transcendent experiences may offer a glimpse into a larger reality, they too are ultimately insufficient in the face of the inexorable pull of meaninglessness. The document stresses that Nihilism is not a problem to be solved but a condition to be understood and confronted. 10: The Inadequacy of Worldly",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************"Courage and the Acceptance of Despair The final section brings into question the concept of ""courage"" as proposed by thinkers like Tillich, who see it as a necessary response to despair and meaninglessness. The draft questions whether this proposed courage is a genuine confrontation with Nihilism or a means of retreating from it. The text suggests that true courage might lie not in facing the world but in acknowledging the futility of doing so. The draft concludes by suggesting that the existential challenge is not to find meaning or happiness within the world but to confront the reality of its absence. It offers a somber perspective that sees the human condition as one of inevitable disillusionment with the world and a constant struggle to make sense of a life that is ultimately without inherent purpose or value. Overall, the draft presents a rigorous philosophical examination of the human condition, Nihilism, and the existential challenges faced by individuals seeking to understand",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************

It encourages readers to go beyond surface-level engagements with life and to confront the profound uncertainties and doubts that define our existence. --- Summary of Madness, Nonexistence, and The Other Part 1: Introduction to Nihilism",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The essay begins by examining the concept of Nihilism and its impact on human consciousness and behavior. Nihilism is essentially the belief in the absence of inherent meaning in life. The author quotes a variety of thinkers who have touched upon existential themes, from the despair and madness that can arise from a deep understanding of human existence to the potential healing that such an understanding might also bring.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The central question posed is whether the full acknowledgement of Nihilism necessarily leads to madness or suicide, or if it can be a path to a different kind of transcendence. The author suggests that while Nihilism can be distinguished from mental illness, it can still lead to profound psychological distress. This distress manifests as a confrontation with the void, or the nothingness, that underlies the façade of everyday life.",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Part 2: Madness, Suicide, and Their Relation to Nihilism",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The essay proceeds to explore how madness and suicide relate to Nihilism. It questions whether these are inevitable outcomes for those who deeply internalize a nihilistic worldview. The writing delves into historical and philosophical figures who have grappled with the despair of Nihilism, and whether or not madness is a state to be embraced as a form of deeper insight or rejected as a destructive end.",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" A specific case is mentioned – that of Mitchell Heisman, a man who committed suicide after writing a 2,000-page manifesto on Nihilism. His act is used to illustrate the potential extremes of a nihilistic perspective, raising the question of whether there can be a rational justification for suicide in a world perceived as inherently irrational.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Part 3: The Search for Authenticity in Nihilism,[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The essay then confronts the topic of authenticity, particularly in the context of suicide. It differentiates between what might be considered ""worldly"" suicide, driven by loss or failure in life's pursuits, and ""nihilistic"" suicide, which stems from a deep engagement with the existential realization of life's meaninglessness.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The author debates whether the nihilistic suicide could be seen as more 'authentic' because it is not an escape but a deliberate choice that aligns with a certain logical consistency when one has fully embraced the void. The worldly suicide, by contrast, might be seen as an attempt to flee from a temporary disruption in an otherwise perceived 'good' life.",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Part 4: The Possibility of a Nihilistic Language of Transcendence,[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The essay moves to consider whether a language or symbolism could be developed that acknowledges the experience of Nihilism while offering a form of transcendence. It questions whether such a language could transform the despair of Nihilism into a spiritual journey, akin to the experiences of saints or mystics, without negating the nihilistic insights into the absurdity of existence.",[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The concept of an ""authentic"" suicide is further analyzed, in which the individual has moved beyond worldly attachments and sees no value in continued existence. This is contrasted with the person who commits suicide due to a loss that disrupts their place in the world. The essay suggests that a person who has fully embraced Nihilism may see suicide as a logical and even ""authentic"" release into the divine or as a final affirmation of their worldview.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Part 5: The Logic of Suicide versus The Logic of Life,[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The essay then juxtaposes the logic of suicide with the logic of life, noting that those who subscribe to the logic of life find it inconceivable to understand the reasoning behind a nihilistic suicide. The majority of people, according to the essay, are immersed in the ""logic of life,"" which involves a commitment to find meaning in everyday existence and activities.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" It's also mentioned that individuals who have encountered the ""Nothing"" of the world cannot fully convey the profundity of their experience to those who haven't questioned or recognized life's inherent meaninglessness.",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Part 6: The Role of Thinking, Madness, and the Divine in Nihilism",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The essay discusses the potential of embracing madness as an ideal, in the sense that it can lead to a profound religious or spiritual experience. It suggests that the terror and the allure of madness might be akin to encountering the divine or the ""Other"" in Nihilism. The writer reflects on how challenging and demanding deep thought can be, and how madness may be a form of ultimate liberation or exploration.",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Part 7: The Dichotomy of Public Perception and Personal Experience,[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Lastly, the essay acknowledges the dichotomy between how society views those who pursue a path of Nihilism and how these individuals perceive themselves. Society often labels them as mad or depressed, while they might see themselves as having a more sincere or deeper grasp of reality. The author points out the irony of society's acceptance of trivial pursuits while mocking or misunderstanding the search.",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Part 8: The Uncomfortable Reality of Nihilism and the Potential for Transcendence,[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The writer contemplates why the embrace of Nihilism often makes others uncomfortable and why thinking deeply about existence can lead to skepticism, despair, and the confrontation with Nihilism. The possibility of finding something divine in the feeling of meaninglessness is pondered — suggesting that such profound discomfort may be a precursor to a unique form of wisdom or enlightenment.",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The essay underlines the difficulty of maintaining a nihilistic perspective, as it requires distancing oneself from the distractions and consolations typically offered by the world.

 ******************Part 15: The Contrast Between Natural Life and Spiritual Death,[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The essay emphasizes the contrast between what is considered 'natural life' — the pursuit of happiness and avoidance of suffering — and 'spiritual death,' where one comes to terms with the ultimate meaninglessness of such pursuits. There's a recognition that the understanding of true despair or the 'sickness unto death,' as Kierkegaard calls it, is beyond the comprehension of the 'natural man.'",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Part 16: Reflection on Personal Despair and the Divine,[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Lastly, the writers reflect on their own struggles with despair and the divine, touching on the idea that profound sadness and a heightened awareness of life's futility can bring one closer to an encounter with the 'Other.'

******************" The essay concludes with a contemplation on the question of suicide within the context of Nihilism. It challenges readers to consider whether suicide, in response to the realization of life's absurdity, might be a rational act or whether it represents a failure to find a more profound response to the void. The text leaves open the question of whether an alternative, more transcendental language of Nihilism could offer a meaningful path forward for those who grapple with these existential dilemmas.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" In essence, your essay is a deep dive into the complex relationship between Nihilism, madness, suicide, and the possibility of transcendence.

 ******************Part 1: Introduction to Nihilism and Its Implications,[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The document is a philosophical exploration of nihilism—the idea that life and existence are inherently meaningless. The writer grapples with the impacts of this perspective on human life and thought, questioning the point of human endeavors, the legitimacy of suicide, and whether a philosophy or religion can be built on the foundation of nihilism. The text seeks to establish whether nihilism possesses any constructive elements that could be interpreted as a form of religious experience or whether it is merely a destructive force.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Part 2: Nihilism's Challenge to Philosophy and Religion,[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The writer criticizes modern philosophy, particularly within American universities, as being detached from existential concerns, reduced to intellectual exercises akin to puzzles. The existence of God, the problem of evil, and the reliance on human reason are called into question. On the other hand, religious philosophy is also challenged for its failure to confront the full implications of nihilism. The writer argues for a philosophy that truly faces the abyss of meaninglessness and does not shy away from the most profound existential questions.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Part 3: The Existential Situation of Humans,[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The text delves into the idea that humans, by nature, engage in constant activity to avoid facing the void—the abyss of meaninglessness that underlies our existence. This avoidance comes in many forms, from the mundane to the intellectual, and is seen as a distraction from confronting nihilism directly. The writer posits that genuine engagement with nihilism is rare and that most philosophical and religious pursuits fail to address it wholly and are thereby fundamentally misguided.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Part 4: The Experience of Nihilism,[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The writer emphasizes that to truly understand nihilism, one must directly experience its profound sense of nothingness. It is through this encounter that the full weight of life's meaninglessness is felt—not as a subjective value judgment but as an objective realization. The document contains various quotes from philosophers that describe this confrontation with nihilism, illustrating the unsettling nature of the experience, where everything familiar becomes strange and insignificant.",[[Infranodus_not_in_graph]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so far)]]******************

******************" The draft continues to explore the absurdity of human activities when viewed against the backdrop of nihilism. It suggests that our actions, accomplishments, and concerns are ultimately futile in the grand scheme of the universe. The text wrestles with the question of why people continue to ascribe meaning to their lives despite the overwhelming evidence of life's transient nature. The writer argues that most people are in denial of the pervasive nothingness that defines existence.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]ar)]******************

 ******************Part 6: The Possibility of Constructive Nihilism,[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]ar)]******************
******************" The writer asks whether nihilism can have any constructive implications. Can the experience of nihilism, with its deep sense of boredom, anxiety, and despair, offer any message or guidance? Is there something beyond the destruction and emptiness that nihilism brings? The text seeks to explore these questions while maintaining a critical stance on the typical answers provided by both religious and secular philosophies.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so far)]]******************

 ******************Part 7: Nihilism's Relation to Transcendence and Religion,[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The draft discusses the concept of ""Transcendence"" as an alternative to ""religious"" experiences, suggesting that nihilism may not only be a deconstructive force but could also lead to a form of transcendence—a wholly Other aspect of human experience. The writer cautions against conflating this transcendence with mystical or supernatural notions, instead focusing on its potential to offer a new understanding of human existence.",[[Infranodus_not_in_graph)]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so far]])******************

 ****************### **Part 8: The Challenge of Living with Nihilism,[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" In the final section, the writer questions how one can live once nihilism is fully acknowledged. It critiques the ways in which society, philosophy, and religion often attempt to sidestep the confrontation with nihilism. The writer concludes that there is no escaping nihilism, that there is no ultimate solution within the world, and that all human attempts to find or create meaning are ultimately doomed to failure in the face of the infinite.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Part 9: The Paradox of Subjective Meaning in an Objective Nihilistic Universe,[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The writer contemplates the paradox of finding subjective meaning in a universe that is objectively meaningless according to nihilism. They examine the human tendency to attach significance to personal experiences, efforts, and achievements, despite their eventual disappearance and lack of enduring impact in the vastness of cosmic time—the so-called 'deep time'. This subjective sense of meaning is seen as a psychological or intellectual defense against the stark reality of existential nullity.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Part 10: The Absurdity of Inventing Meaning,[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************The document illustrates the absurdity of inventing meaning through a metaphorical scenario where two people play a game of tennis without a ball. This scenario is used to highlight the futility of engaging in activities that lack inherent purpose or substance. The writer questions how long one can maintain such an illusory sense of meaning before it ultimately becomes unsatisfying or unbearable.,[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Part 11: The Rarity of Nihilistic Experience and Its Consequences,[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The writer discusses the rarity of a true nihilistic experience, where the full weight of life's meaninglessness is felt, and the implications of such an experience. They suggest that the busyness of life, the distractions we create, and the evasion of the uncanny nature of existence are ways in which we miss or ignore the message that nihilism may carry. The text ponders why the experience of nihilism is not more common and what it means for those seeking authenticity and a deeper understanding of human existence.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Part 12: The Potential of a Philosophy or Language of Nihilism,[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Finally, the draft proposes the challenge of developing a philosophy or language that stems from the direct experience of nihilism. The writer recognizes the need for a framework that acknowledges the destructive aspects of nihilism but also explores its potential for constructive content, even if it might ultimately be illusory. The possibility of nihilism leading to madness, suicide, or a transcendent Other is considered, leaving open the question of what lies beyond the experience of meaninglessness.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The document concludes with the notion that nihilism, as the ground for all transcendent thinking, demands an emphasis on direct experience over theoretical speculation. Through various quotes from philosophers and thinkers, the writer tries to convey the gravity of confronting nihilism and the profound yet often overlooked impact it has on every aspect of human life and thought. --- Summary of The Symbolic Resonance of Nothing",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************

******************" The draft is a philosophical exploration of Nihilism and its implications for language, existence, and the human condition. The writer investigates whether it's possible to develop a language that authentically engages with the concept of Nihilism—a worldview that sees life and the universe as lacking inherent meaning or value. The document contemplates how such a language can navigate the ""Nothing"" that Nihilism proposes while also allowing for the possibility of transcending this meaninglessness.",[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The author references various philosophers and thinkers, such as Martin Heidegger, to discuss the challenges of facing the abyss of human consciousness and the ultimate reality—or lack thereof. Central to the discussion are questions about the role of philosophical thinking vis-à-vis Nihilism, the potential for a Nihilistic language to express and confront the ""Nothing,"" and the human mind's ability to grapple with a seemingly meaningless existence.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************The Dilemma of Language and Nihilism,[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The writer begins by addressing the inadequacy of language when it comes to discussing Nihilism. They argue that clichés and ""idle talk"" fail to capture the depth and implications of a Nihilistic perspective, suggesting that traditional expressions are insufficient to convey the true experience of Nihilism, which is characterized by its non-transferable nature.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************The Human Condition and Nihilism,[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The draft delves into the human tendency to seek meaning and security in the face of a potentially meaningless existence. It questions whether humans can authentically confront Nihilism without succumbing to self-deception or escaping into comforting illusions. The author examines the possibility of ""Being-towards-death,"" as described by Heidegger, and whether humans can embrace this existential standpoint.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Heidegger's Influence and Language Development,[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Heidegger's concepts are presented as the foundation for developing a language of Nihilism, with terms such as ""anxiety,"" ""authenticity,"" and ""Being-Towards-Death"" providing insights into the human condition that could pave the way for a Nihilistic language. However, this raises the question of whether Heidegger's analysis, often labeled ""atheistic,"" can be reconciled with religious perspectives, like those of Thomas Merton.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************The Search for a Nihilistic Language,[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The author proposes the term ""Nihiltheism"" as a way to ground the experience of Nihilism without falling into the traps of naturalistic or religious worldviews. This language is meant to be symbolic and self-critical, always open for reinterpretation. The intention is not to provide comfort from the Nothingness but to confront it and allow for a genuine encounter with the terror of existence.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************The Challenge of Describing Nihilistic Experience,[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************

 ******************The Role of Silence and Renunciation,[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The draft suggests that those who have truly encountered Nihilism may be left with no choice but to embrace a silent acknowledgment of their condition. However, it also points out that few are willing to completely renounce the world, underscoring that experiencing Nothing and renouncing everything are not the same.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Affirmative Aspects of Nihilism,[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The author explores whether there is something affirmative within the experience of Nihilism that can be used to develop a language capable of acknowledging and transcending worldly suffering. They reference the mystic Cioran’s idea of the ""affirmative substance"" of Nothing, where even in the realization of life's futility, one can find a path towards a higher reality.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************The Need for a New Language,[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The need for a language that addresses Nihilism is tied to the human desire to confront rather than replace the Transcendental yearning that Nihilism evokes. The writer quotes Aldous Huxley on the limitations of conventional theology and the necessity for a language that can be comprehended only by those who have transcended ordinary, unregenerate experiences.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Heidegger's Terms as a Foundation,[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Using Heidegger's framework, the draft outlines the basic structure of a potential language of Nihilism, focusing on the concept of ""Being-Towards-Death."" This concept involves experiencing anxiety in a profound moment that calls the individual to understand something incommunicable, leading to a sense of insignificance in the world and a push towards authenticity.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Heidegger vs. Religious Perspectives,[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The author compares Heidegger's notion of ""Being-Towards-Death"" with the views of Trappist monk Thomas Merton, who also acknowledges the emptiness of constant outward seeking. The comparison raises the question of whether the language of Nihilism could bridge the gap between the atheistic overtones often ascribed to Heidegger's philosophy and the theistic language used by Merton.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Transcendence Through Nihilism,[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The writer examines the concept of the ""True-Self"" and how it might be understood in a way that transcends both naturalistic and religious interpretations. They express skepticism about traditional religious approaches that offer answers rather than embracing the mystery of existence, which is seen as a form of idolatry.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************The Futile Optimism and Scientific Realism,[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The draft criticizes the 'optimistic' outlook prevalent in American culture and certain scientific circles, where empirical reality is regarded as the ultimate truth without questioning the underlying reasons for existence. The author argues that this 'optimistic scientism' is a form of 'unthinking' that fails to acknowledge the deeper philosophical questions.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************The Rejection of Traditional Religious Interpretations,[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The writer takes issue with traditional religious interpretations of the human condition, which often rely on unexamined theological assumptions, rituals, and dogmas. By contrast, the proposed language of Nihilism would focus on the relentless inquiry into the nature of Being rather than providing pre-packaged answers.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Conclusion and Further Exploration,[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" In summary, the writer advocates for a language of Nihilism that would serve as a map through the Nothingness of the world without claiming to offer 'truth'. This language should be filled with doubt, continually asking ""Why?"" and preparing the individual for the possibility of transcendence. The draft concludes with an invitation to further explore the tensions between the experience of Nihilism and the development of a language that can genuinely reflect it.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************

These notes reflect the ongoing struggle to articulate a coherent response to Nihilism and suggest the shape that a future language might take.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The writer ends with a reflection on the non-transferability of the Nihilistic experience and the paradox of developing a language for something that inherently resists articulation. This contradiction is acknowledged with a degree of irony, suggesting that the very act of trying to create a language for Nihilism may be inherently flawed or futile.",[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************The Universality and Rarity of Nihilism,[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The draft touches on the universality of the Nihilistic experience, which, while being a fundamental aspect of being human, is rarely confronted directly due to its challenging and unsettling nature. The writer asks why this experience is so infrequently and fully embraced, positing that the difficulty lies in the intensity and profundity of fully realizing Nihilism.",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Final Thoughts on Nihilistic Language,[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" In the concluding thoughts, the author grapples with the purpose and potential utility of a Nihilistic language. They ponder whether such a language serves as a guide through the Nothingness of the world, facilitating a push towards transcendence, or whether it's merely replacing traditional religious rituals with another form of structure. The language of Nihilism is envisioned as a tentative and doubting map, constantly questioning and open to reinterpretation, rather than as a doctrine offering certainty and closure.",[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
 ******************Reflections on Quietism and Solitude,[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" The draft ends with reflections on the relationship between the proposed language and concepts like quietism and solitude. Given that idle talk and distraction are seen as barriers to confronting Nihilism, the language of Nihilism might necessitate solitude and silence as conditions for its development and understanding.",[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[txt: all works of nihiltheism (so f]]******************
******************" Your draft presents a deep and nuanced examination of Nihilism and the possibility of a language that could engage with its existential challenges. It's a complex blend of philosophical inquiry, critical assessment of both religious and atheistic interpretations of existence, and a search for an authentic means of expressing the inexpressible.

It challenges the conventional understandings of nihilism found in mainstream philosophy, aiming to offer a new interpretation that feels more authentic to the author's personal experience. The writer emphasizes a non-traditional approach by extensively quoting from various thinkers without feeling the need to defend this method. The quotes are intended to show different perspectives converging towards a single, unified insight into the experience of nihilism. The author expresses a desire for their own voice to be lost  among these citations, implying that the message is more significant than the messenger.

Part 3: Philosophical Quotes and Their Role  The author continues to weave in quotes from different philosophers and thinkers, using their ideas to underscore the complexity of the  human condition and the struggle to find meaning. These quotes serve to illustrate the shared insights of various philosophers, suggesting an underlying unity in their descriptions of existential  experiences. The inclusion of these quotes is meant to demonstrate that regardless of the diverse backgrounds or labels of the thinkers— whether they are Christian, Hindu, Nihilist, or otherwise—their  experiences and articulations of nihilism are fundamentally similar.

Part 5: Nihilism as Inescapable Truth  In this section, the author suggests that nihilism is the only 'truth' that can be universally experienced or 'known' by humans, as it does not offer answers but rather represents the lack of them. The  experience of nihilism is depicted as something that cuts through the fabric of all human convictions, revealing the absence of ultimate knowledge or paths to follow. It is portrayed as unavoidable, inherent in every human life, whether acknowledged or not.

The text implies that the author seeks no validation or approval for their thoughts, instead aligning themselves with the quoted thinkers as equals in their confrontation with nihilism. Part 8: Philosophical and Religious Vocations  A comparison is drawn between the calling of a poet and that of a priest, implying that true commitment to a calling—whether in art or religion—requires something more profound than mere certification or examination.

They express skepticism about the value of their own writing and the act of writing in general, as well as a desire to make others uncomfortable and to challenge them to  confront the abyss of existence. The draft ends with the author positioning themselves as an observer of the absurdity of attempting to describe the indescribable. The additional notes and quotes at the end of the draft suggest further development of concepts discussed in the main text, such as reflections on the nature of despair, the concept of immortality , and the universal aspects of nihilism. These notes seem to serve as a reservoir of ideas for expanding the main text. Part 10: Immortality and the Afterlife  The author challenges traditional notions of immortality and the afterlife, arguing that seeking eternal life or heaven often reflects a naïve faith or a misunderstanding of the human condition.

Part 11: Universal Experience of Nihilism  The author incorporates quotes that emphasize the universality of nihilism, suggesting that all people, knowingly or unknowingly, experience despair—a central theme in nihilist thought. This despair  is not tied to any particular life event or situation but is an inherent part of the human condition, a consequence of our confrontation with existence itself. Part 12: The Illusion of Simple Salvation  In the final portion of the notes, the idea of simple salvation is explored. The document questions the possibility of achieving an easy resolution to the complex issues raised by nihilism, suggesting  that such an attempt would be futile. The author returns to Kierkegaard's thoughts, which highlight the inadequacy of superficial  solutions and the depth required to truly engage with spiritual matters.

The author stresses the importance of seeking one's own understanding rather than blindly following established doctrines.

Conclusion Overall, the document presents a deep dive into nihilism, as both a philosophical concept and a personal experience. It is rich with  quotes and reflections that span centuries and cultures, yet coalesce around the central theme of meaninglessness. The author's writing is both an exploration and a confession, a testament of the struggle  between the desire for truth and the acceptance of the intrinsic unknowability inherent to human existence. It is not so much a  systematic study but more a narrative journey through the various landscapes of nihilist thought.

******************" The Abyssal Experience of Nihilism (Edit) -Philosophy and Direct Experience- Part 1: Introduction to The Abyssal Experience of Nihilism Exploration of Nihilism: The document delves into nihilism, a philosophical concept that suggests life, values, and the universe inherently lack meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. It grapples with  the implications of embracing a nihilistic viewpoint and how it affects our understanding of existence. Philosophy and Life's Significance: The text opens by questioning the significance of life and philosophical inquiry. It  references Cicero's belief that philosophy prepares one for death and Heidegger's thoughts on being struck by the strangeness of existence,  which leads to the fundamental ""Why?"" of life. Human Activity and Meaninglessness: The idea that human actions are ultimately meaningless is presented. The text suggests ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: asumofrenlex]]******************
******************" that much of what drives human behavior—our goals and distractions—are rooted in an ignorance of nihilism. The breakdown  of these distractions can force one to confront nihilism directly, raising questions about the rationality of suicide, the possibility of  living with a sense of Nothingness, and the potential for a religious experience or philosophy that can incorporate this sense of nothing. Part 2: Philosophy's Role and Limitations Critique of Academic Philosophy: The draft criticizes contemporary academic philosophy, particularly the American university approach, as having become a sterile intellectual exercise  akin to solving a puzzle, disconnected from existential concerns. It argues that philosophy has lost touch with the profound questions of  existence due to an overemphasis on analytic reasoning.

******************" Atheism and the Problem of Evil: The document challenges atheist philosophers on the grounds that their rejection of God and reliance on human reason lack a non-pragmatic basis in a naturalistic worldview, questioning why reason should be valued  over absurdity in a purposeless universe. Religious Philosophy and Its Shortcomings: Religious philosophers are criticized for offering weak defenses of their beliefs  and for not engaging deeply enough with skepticism. This is linked to the notion that philosophy has strayed from its Socratic roots, which  were more inquisitive and less concerned with providing definite answers. Part 3: Existential Conditions and Philosophy's Potential Existential Disillusionment: The text discusses how, when the veneer of life's immediate concerns is stripped away, individuals may confront a profound sense of disillusionment and the  meaninglessness of their achievements in the face of death and the vastness of time.

******************" argue that philosophy, in its traditional form, cannot fully address the human confrontation with death. It suggests that most philosophies dodge the issue of mortality and fail to acknowledge the transformative impact of facing one's finitude. Philosophy as Interpretation: The author posits that philosophy should not be seen as a provider of definitive truths but rather as a method to interpret and explain existence. This interpretation leads  to the conclusion that philosophy should aim to create a 'map of consequences' derived from the direct human experience of nihilism. Confronting the Void of Existence: A significant portion of the document focuses on the existential experience of facing the  'Nothing'—the realization that life may have no inherent meaning. This encounter with nothingness is described as a transformative,  albeit rare, event that can shake an individual's worldview to its core.

******************" possibility of interpreting this experience in a way that isn't purely negative. The Role of Philosophy in Nihilism: The author suggests that philosophy should not be engaged in the business of formulating arguments or systems of knowledge, but rather in understanding and articulating the 'reality' of experiences like boredom, anxiety, despair, and ecstasy that are associated with nihilism. Heidegger's Analysis of Human Condition: Philosopher Martin Heidegger's work is invoked to dissect the human condition, emphasizing the importance of not predefining experiences with atheistic or theistic language to avoid confusion and to capture the  essence of the experience of nothingness. Re-defining 'Religious' Experience: The text calls for a redefinition or avoidance of the term 'religious' due to its various  connotations and instead suggests using 'Transcendence' to describe experiences that reach beyond mundane existence.

This state is not necessarily religious in the traditional sense but is an acknowledgment of  something that is ""Wholly-Other."" Naturalism vs. Transcendental Interpretations: The author contrasts naturalistic interpretations, which ground human  experience and understanding in materialism and science, with transcendental ones that suggest there may be more to human  existence than what's observable or measurable. The Ground of Transcendent Thinking: Various depths of nihilism are explored as a possible common foundation for all forms of transcendental thinking, suggesting that these experiences are  universal, though often avoided or misinterpreted.

******************" Rarity of Nihilism's Experience: The text reflects on how the everyday distractions and engagements of life often prevent people from confronting the full weight of nihilism. It posits that even  though nihilism is a universal undercurrent, the direct and transformative experience of it is rare. Part 6: Implications and Paths Forward The Rarity of Nihilistic Experiences: The text suggests that the reason full encounters with nihilism are rare is due to an instinctual  or conscious inclination to engage with the world. This engagement masks the underlying nothingness, allowing individuals to feel they are living meaningful lives despite the potential absence of intrinsic  meaning. Madness, Suicide, and the Other: The author then touches on the potential outcomes of facing nihilism: madness, suicide, or a turn  towards the Other (which could represent a form of transcendence or ultimate reality).

******************" Philosophy's Limitations and Contributions: Philosophy is seen as having the potential to contribute to understanding nihilism if it can move beyond traditional frameworks and engage directly with human experiences of nothingness. The document argues for a  philosophy rooted in the lived experience rather than abstract theorization. The Struggle with Nothingness: The draft considers the struggle with nothingness as a defining aspect of human existence. It weighs the possibility that this struggle may contain a hidden message or  revelation that could reshape one's understanding of life. The Inevitability of Nihilism: Finally, the document contends that there is no ultimate escape from nihilism; it is an ever-present reality beneath the surface of existence. It challenges readers to  consider how one might authentically engage with this reality and potentially find a path through it that does not lead to despair. --- Summary:",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: asumofrenlex]]******************
******************" The Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism (Edit) -Awaken, Material Nightmare- Part 1: Introduction and the Philosophical Dilemma Your document begins with an exploration of the struggle between traditional religious belief and a modern understanding that might exclude the presence of a divine entity or ultimate reality. The opening quotes from Spong, Sartre, and  Vivekananda set the stage for a discussion on the challenges that contemporary individuals face when reconciling their spiritual  beliefs with a scientific and practical worldview. The text suggests that many people have come to the brink of what's described as a Nihilistic experience—a profound sense of the meaningless or absurdity of life—but instead of confronting  it, they turn away and distract themselves with various activities. This turning away is likened to an ""always falling"" condition, tied to Western and Christian cultural constructs such as 'original sin' ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: asumofrenlex]]******************

This divided-self is depicted as inescapable and pervasive, influencing how people react to the world and their place within it. Through various philosophical and religious quotes, the draft  illustrates the inner conflict that arises from this condition. The implication is that most people settle for superficial solutions to  this conflict, avoiding genuine engagement with the philosophical and existential questions that arise from this divided state of being. The document continues with a deeper look into despair and the human condition through the eyes of existential thinkers like Kierkegaard and Heidegger.

******************" Part 3: The Allure of Naturalism and the Experience of Guilt mundane life is one of inauthenticity, a sort of patchwork existence that covers up the underlying despair and meaninglessness. Several religious perspectives are brought into the conversation, suggesting that genuine religiosity involves a profound dissatisfaction with the world and a renunciation of its superficialities. This renunciation is not an intellectual exercise  but a lived experience of turning away from the world—a common thread in many mystical traditions, like those of  Christianity, Buddhism, and Taoism. The discussion highlights the struggle between the worldly and the spiritual. The draft delves into the tension between naturalism—the focus on the material and finite world—and the pull toward something  beyond this, a Transcendent aspect of reality.

******************" Part 4: The Human Condition and Renunciation of the World Various religious and philosophical figures are cited to support this idea, including Vivekananda, who criticizes the materialistic  inability to live authentically or to realize a ""True Self"" that is more than just the sum of naturalistic impulses. Heidegger is referenced to articulate a more existential understanding of guilt, one that is an essential part of being and arising from our natural tendency to be absorbed by the world rather than being authentically ourselves. Guilt, in this sense, is not about social or moral failings but about the failure to  recognize and actualize our deepest potentialities. The text moves on to discuss the idea of renunciation as a response to the divided nature of human consciousness. It suggests that only those who have seen the illusory nature of  material concerns and worldly attachments can truly grasp the human condition. This understanding often leads to a negative  or",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: asumofrenlex]]******************

The draft also brings in Luther and other thinkers to emphasize the point that true faith and spirituality may involve a fundamental detachment from the world and its transient concerns. Part 5: Nihilism, Indifference, and Participation Part 6: Worldly Meaning vs. Transcendental Significance The document further explores the concept of Nihilism and how it represents an ultimate confrontation with the meaninglessness  of existence. Rather than proposing solutions, Nihilism compels individuals to face the abyss, leading to either indifference or a  radical form of participation that grapples with the void itself. This section debates whether the act of participating in life, with its inherent lack of ultimate meaning, offers any genuine value. As the draft continues, it contrasts the overwhelming draw of worldly meaning with the potential for a Transcendental perspective.

The text references thinkers like Huxley, who critique the modern tendency to place undue importance on progress and human achievement, suggesting that this perspective leads to a distorted understanding of reality. The argument unfolds around  the idea that true liberation from the horrors of existence comes not from the attachment to worldly concerns but from a  profound realization of the world's unreality. The draft posits that many people live inauthentically, ignoring the despair and meaninglessness that underpin human  existence. Nihilism is seen as a destructive force that cannot be easily reconciled with a return to normal life once it has been fully realized; the world becomes transparent and dead to those  who experience it.",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: asumofrenlex]]******************
******************" Part 8: Reflections on Science, Religion, Unthinking, and the Human Predicament The text concludes with a reflection on the function of Nihilism in pushing individuals beyond superficial engagements with the world. It challenges the reader to consider why anyone would want to participate in Nihilism, suggesting that it is not an end in  itself but a means to confront and perhaps transcend the limitations of existence. Finally, the draft examines the shortcomings of both the scientific and religious communities in addressing the profound questions of existence. It criticizes the scientific focus on  describing reality without asking the deeper ""why"" behind it and the religious tendency to offer pre-packaged answers rather than  embracing the mystery of being. Philosophers are not spared from this critique. The document suggests that many philosophers lack a direct experience of the issues they discuss and therefore fall short of offering  meaningful insights.

Throughout, the draft emphasizes the need for a philosophical approach that remains open to the questions and mysteries inherent in being human. By comparing the casual acceptance of existence to the profound sense of ""cosmic panic"" that some argue is central to the human experience, the draft indicates that  a truly philosophical outlook must grapple with the absurdity and uncanniness of life. In exploring the depths of doubt and skepticism, the draft highlights how they are not only integral to the experience of Nihilism but can also serve as a pathway to a more profound  understanding of existence. It acknowledges that while mystical and transcendent experiences may offer a glimpse into a larger  reality, they too are ultimately insufficient in the face of the inexorable pull of meaninglessness.

******************" Part 10: The Inadequacy of Worldly Courage and the Acceptance of Despair The final section brings into question the concept of ""courage"" as proposed by thinkers like Tillich, who see it as a necessary  response to despair and meaninglessness. The draft questions whether this proposed courage is a genuine confrontation with Nihilism or a means of retreating from it. The text suggests that true courage might lie not in facing the world but in  acknowledging the futility of doing so. The draft concludes by suggesting that the existential challenge is not to find meaning or happiness within the world but to confront the reality of its absence. It offers a somber perspective  that sees the human condition as one of inevitable disillusionment with the world and a constant struggle to make  sense of a life that is ultimately without inherent purpose or value.

The essay begins by examining the concept of Nihilism and its impact on human consciousness and behavior. Nihilism is  essentially the belief in the absence of inherent meaning in life. The author quotes a variety of thinkers who have touched upon existential themes, from the despair and madness that can arise  from a deep understanding of human existence to the potential healing that such an understanding might also bring. The central question posed is whether the full acknowledgement ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: asumofrenlex]]******************
******************" Part 2: Madness, Suicide, and Their Relation to Nihilism of Nihilism necessarily leads to madness or suicide, or if it can be a path to a different kind of transcendence. The author suggests that while Nihilism can be distinguished from mental illness, it can still lead to profound psychological distress. This distress  manifests as a confrontation with the void, or the nothingness, that underlies the façade of everyday life. The essay proceeds to explore how madness and suicide relate to Nihilism. It questions whether these are inevitable outcomes for those who deeply internalize a nihilistic worldview. The writing delves into historical and philosophical figures who have  grappled with the despair of Nihilism, and whether or not madness is a state to be embraced as a form of deeper insight or  rejected as a destructive end.

The essay then confronts the topic of authenticity, particularly in the context of suicide. It differentiates between what might be considered ""worldly"" suicide, driven by loss or failure in life's pursuits, and ""nihilistic"" suicide, which stems from a deep engagement with the existential realization of life's  meaninglessness. The author debates whether the nihilistic suicide could be seen as more 'authentic' because it is not an escape but a deliberate choice that aligns with a certain logical consistency when one has  fully embraced the void. The worldly suicide, by contrast, might be seen as an attempt to flee from a temporary disruption in an  otherwise perceived 'good' life.

The concept of an ""authentic"" suicide is further analyzed, in which the individual has moved beyond worldly attachments and sees no value in continued existence. This is contrasted with the  person who commits suicide due to a loss that disrupts their place in the world. The essay suggests that a person who has fully  embraced Nihilism may see suicide as a logical and even ""authentic"" release into the divine or as a final affirmation of their worldview. The essay then juxtaposes the logic of suicide with the logic of life, noting that those who subscribe to the logic of life find it inconceivable to understand the reasoning behind a nihilistic suicide.

The essay discusses the potential of embracing madness as an ideal, in the sense that it can lead to a profound religious or  spiritual experience. It suggests that the terror and the allure of madness might be akin to encountering the divine or the ""Other"" in Nihilism. The writer reflects on how challenging and  demanding deep thought can be, and how madness may be a form of ultimate liberation or exploration. Lastly, the essay acknowledges the dichotomy between how society views those who pursue a path of Nihilism and how these individuals perceive themselves.

Part 9: The Varied Responses to the Realization of Life's Absurdity more sincere or deeper grasp of reality. The author points out the irony of society's acceptance of trivial pursuits while mocking or misunderstanding the search.

For some, the awareness can lead to an obsessive engagement with the meaninglessness, rejecting all distractions. For others, this realization might be a cause for despair and a  temptation towards suicide. The essay probes whether there's a ""correct"" response to Nihilism, whether it's suicide, faith, or some form of transcendence. The text distinguishes between types of suicide, suggesting that some may result from a retreat from worldly failure and others from a deeper nihilistic realization. The question is raised  whether the motivation behind a suicide could affect its meaning or authenticity, and whether those who have not lost all worldly  attachments can be pulled back from the brink.

Throughout the essay, the author reflects on the complex nature of suicide, the role of individual experiences in shaping one's response to Nihilism, and the possibility of finding some form of redemption or purpose through an embrace of the void. The essay's extra notes and quotes section provides additional context and scholarly support for the main themes, providing a  wealth of insights from various philosophers, mystics, and writers who have addressed the themes of Nihilism, madness,  and transcendence.

The authors cited in the extra notes suggest that suffering and solitude can play significant roles in spiritual awakening.

There's a recognition that the understanding of true despair or the 'sickness unto death,' as Kierkegaard calls it, is beyond the  comprehension of the 'natural man.' Lastly, the writers reflect on their own struggles with despair and the divine, touching on the idea that profound sadness and a heightened awareness of life's futility can bring one closer to an  encounter with the 'Other.' They express the paradoxical nature of such experiences — the more one becomes aware of life's meaninglessness, the closer one may come to experiencing a The essay reiterates the notion that true",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: asumofrenlex]]******************

The philosophers and writers cited suggest that through this process, one may arrive at a state of being that is fundamentally at odds with societal norms, which often value superficial distractions  over deep contemplation. Society's discomfort with the nihilistic journey is further examined, as those who seek meaning beyond conventional  understandings often face ridicule or are deemed unwell. The thinkers highlighted in the notes argue that the societal impulse to 'cure' or 'correct' those who reject life's superficial pleasures is  misguided and fails to recognize the legitimacy and potential depth of their existential crisis.

Finally, the essay touches on the tension between reason and the instinct for life. The writers discuss the struggle to reconcile intellectual convictions — such as the understanding of life's meaninglessness — with the instinctive desire to continue living.  This inner conflict is seen as an essential part of the human condition and a driving force behind the quest for understanding  and meaning. The essay concludes with a contemplation on the question of suicide within the context of Nihilism. It challenges readers to  consider whether suicide, in response to the realization of life's absurdity, might be a rational act or whether it represents a failure to find a more profound response to the void.

******************" In essence, your essay is a deep dive into the complex relationship between Nihilism, madness, suicide, and the possibility of transcendence. It engages with a wide range of philosophical  viewpoints to explore how individuals might reconcile with or resist the inherent meaninglessness of life and what implications this has for understanding the human condition. --- Summary: The Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness (Edit) -The Remembering of the Recollected Self- Part 1: Introduction to Nihilism and Its Implications",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: asumofrenlex]]******************
******************" Part 2: Nihilism's Challenge to Philosophy and Religion The document is a philosophical exploration of nihilism—the idea that life and existence are inherently meaningless. The writer grapples with the impacts of this perspective on human life and thought, questioning the point of human endeavors, the  legitimacy of suicide, and whether a philosophy or religion can be built on the foundation of nihilism. The text seeks to establish whether nihilism possesses any constructive elements that could be interpreted as a form of religious experience or whether it is  merely a destructive force. The writer criticizes modern philosophy, particularly within American universities, as being detached from existential concerns, reduced to intellectual exercises akin to puzzles. The  existence of God, the problem of evil, and the reliance on human reason are called into question. On the other hand, religious  philosophy is also challenged for its failure to confront the full implications of",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: asumofrenlex]]******************

This avoidance  comes in many forms, from the mundane to the intellectual, and is seen as a distraction from confronting nihilism directly. The writer posits that genuine engagement with nihilism is rare and that most philosophical and religious pursuits fail to address it  wholly and are thereby fundamentally misguided. The writer emphasizes that to truly understand nihilism, one must directly experience its profound sense of nothingness. It is  through this encounter that the full weight of life's meaninglessness is felt—not as a subjective value judgment but  as an objective realization.

It suggests that our actions, accomplishments, and concerns are ultimately futile in the grand scheme of the universe. The text wrestles with the question of why people continue to ascribe meaning to their lives  despite the overwhelming evidence of life's transient nature. The writer argues that most people are in denial of the pervasive nothingness that defines existence. The writer asks whether nihilism can have any constructive implications. Can the experience of nihilism, with its deep sense of boredom, anxiety, and despair, offer any message or guidance? Is there something beyond the destruction and  emptiness that nihilism brings?

In the final section, the writer questions how one can live once nihilism is fully acknowledged. It critiques the ways in which society, philosophy, and religion often attempt to sidestep the  confrontation with nihilism. The writer concludes that there is no escaping nihilism, that there is no ultimate solution within the world, and that all human attempts to find or create meaning  are ultimately doomed to failure in the face of the infinite.

This subjective sense of meaning is seen as a psychological or intellectual defense against the stark reality of existential nullity. The document illustrates the absurdity of inventing meaning through a metaphorical scenario where two people play a game of tennis without a ball. This scenario is used to highlight the  futility of engaging in activities that lack inherent purpose or substance. The writer questions how long one can maintain such  an illusory sense of meaning before it ultimately becomes unsatisfying or unbearable. The writer discusses the rarity of a true nihilistic experience, where the full weight of life's meaninglessness is felt, and the implications of such an experience. They suggest that the busyness of life, the distractions we create, and the evasion of the uncanny nature of existence",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: asumofrenlex]]******************

Through various quotes from philosophers and thinkers, the writer tries to convey the gravity of confronting nihilism and the profound yet often  for those seeking authenticity and a deeper understanding of human existence. Finally, the draft proposes the challenge of developing a philosophy or language that stems from the direct experience of nihilism. The writer recognizes the need for a framework that  acknowledges the destructive aspects of nihilism but also explores its potential for constructive content, even if it might  ultimately be illusory.

******************" ""Nothing"" that Nihilism proposes while also allowing for the possibility of transcending this meaninglessness. The author references various philosophers and thinkers, such as Martin Heidegger, to discuss the challenges of facing the abyss of human consciousness and the ultimate reality—or lack thereof. Central to the discussion are questions about the role of philosophical thinking vis-à-vis Nihilism, the potential for a  Nihilistic language to express and confront the ""Nothing,"" and the human mind's ability to grapple with a seemingly meaningless  existence. Part 1: The Dilemma of Language and Nihilism Part 2: The Human Condition and Nihilism The writer begins by addressing the inadequacy of language when it comes to discussing Nihilism.

It questions whether humans can authentically confront Nihilism without succumbing to self-deception or escaping into comforting illusions. The author examines the possibility of  ""Being-towards-death,"" as described by Heidegger, and whether humans can embrace this existential standpoint. Heidegger's concepts are presented as the foundation for developing a language of Nihilism, with terms such as ""anxiety,"" ""authenticity,"" and ""Being-Towards-Death"" providing insights into the human condition that could pave the way for a Nihilistic  language. However, this raises the question of whether Heidegger's analysis, often labeled ""atheistic,"" can be reconciled  with religious perspectives, like those of Thomas Merton. The author proposes the term ""Nihiltheism"" as a way to ground the experience of Nihilism without falling into the",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: asumofrenlex]]******************

The writer acknowledges the difficulty in finding words that adequately capture the Nihilistic experience. They cite St.  Therese of Lisieux's struggle to articulate her spiritual darkness within a Christian framework as an example of the challenges  inherent in conveying deeply personal and transformative experiences. The draft suggests that those who have truly encountered Nihilism may be left with no choice but to embrace a silent acknowledgment of their condition. However, it also points out that few are willing to completely renounce the world, underscoring that experiencing Nothing and renouncing everything are not the same.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: asumofrenlex]]******************
******************" Part 8: The Need for a New Language Part 9: Heidegger's Terms as a Foundation The author explores whether there is something affirmative within the experience of Nihilism that can be used to develop a language capable of acknowledging and transcending worldly suffering. They reference the mystic Cioran’s idea of the  ""affirmative substance"" of Nothing, where even in the realization of life's futility, one can find a path towards a higher reality. The need for a language that addresses Nihilism is tied to the human desire to confront rather than replace the Transcendental  yearning that Nihilism evokes. The writer quotes Aldous Huxley on the limitations of conventional theology and the necessity for a language that can be comprehended only by those who have  transcended ordinary, unregenerate experiences. Using Heidegger's framework, the draft outlines the basic structure of a potential language of Nihilism, focusing on the concept of ""Being-Towards-Death.""

The author compares Heidegger's notion of ""Being-TowardsDeath"" with the views of Trappist monk Thomas Merton, who also acknowledges the emptiness of constant outward seeking. The comparison raises the question of whether the language of Nihilism could bridge the gap between the atheistic overtones  often ascribed to Heidegger's philosophy and the theistic language used by Merton. The writer examines the concept of the ""True-Self"" and how it might be understood in a way that transcends both naturalistic and religious interpretations.

The author argues that this  'optimistic scientism' is a form of 'unthinking' that fails to acknowledge the deeper philosophical questions. The writer takes issue with traditional religious interpretations of the human condition, which often rely on unexamined theological assumptions, rituals, and dogmas. By contrast, the proposed language of Nihilism would focus on the relentless  inquiry into the nature of Being rather than providing prepackaged answers In summary, the writer advocates for a language of Nihilism that would serve as a map through the Nothingness of the world without claiming to offer 'truth'.

An assortment of additional thoughts and quotes from Heidegger and other thinkers are provided, which the author plans to incorporate into a more polished piece. These notes  reflect the ongoing struggle to articulate a coherent response to Nihilism and suggest the shape that a future language might  take. The writer ends with a reflection on the non-transferability of the Nihilistic experience and the paradox of developing a language for something that inherently resists articulation. This  contradiction is acknowledged with a degree of irony, suggesting that the very act of trying to create a language for Nihilism may  be inherently flawed or futile.

In the concluding thoughts, the author grapples with the purpose and potential utility of a Nihilistic language. They ponder  whether such a language serves as a guide through the Nothingness of the world, facilitating a push towards  transcendence, or whether it's merely replacing traditional religious rituals with another form of structure. The language of Nihilism is envisioned as a tentative and doubting map,  constantly questioning and open to reinterpretation, rather than as a doctrine offering certainty and closure.

******************"   \### Step 1: Existential Despair, Search for Meaning, and the Absurd     The experience of existential despair, the relentless search for meaning, and the confrontation with the absurd are central themes that permeate the nihilistic narratives within this document. Kierkegaard's notion of anxiety as a ""school"" that reveals the truth of one's situation resonates with Becker's assertion that ""man cannot endure his own littleness unless he can translate it into meaningfulness on the largest possible level.""

Interdisciplinary and Comparative Analysis Initial Scholarly Analysis: Religion and Theology The quotes from Tillich highlight the profound separation between the finite and the infinite, echoing the sentiments expressed by Vivekananda and others. Tillich emphasizes that the ""holy"" transcends this realm, and there is an ""infinite distance"" between the finite and the infinite. This resonates with Therese of Lisieux's recognition that ""there is no way of reaching the infinite.""Tillich also underscores the symbolic nature of religious language and the need to avoid idolatrous distortions, where the finite symbols are mistaken for the infinite itself.

However, as Tillich and others have argued, the very act of negating or rejecting the notion of an ""ultimate concern"" could itself be seen as an expression of such a concern, highlighting the self-refuting nature of certain forms of skepticism or nihilism.Cioran's observation that ""the conflict between religions is not a conflict between forms of belief, but it is a conflict between expressions of our ... ultimate concern"" could be challenged by those who argue that religious and ideological conflicts are often rooted in more mundane factors, such as power struggles, cultural differences, or economic interests.

However, Becker's point seems to be that this very embrace of finitude and limitation is itself a form of ""meaningfulness on the largest possible level,"" suggesting that the human yearning for meaning and purpose is inescapable, even in its apparent negation.Overall, while these critical perspectives and potential counterarguments raise important questions and challenges, they also seem to reinforce the central theme of the universality of the experience of nihilism and the human yearning for the infinite, even if the specific expressions and responses to this",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: journal314 universal experience of nihilism]]******************

How, then, is Nihilism with its Transcendental interpretation to be, in any  substantial sense, distinguished from Naturalism? Is Nihilism necessarily to be reduced to naturalism? Are there characteristics of Nihilism that separates itself from, and go beyond, naturalism? Is there any way to 'touch' the Transcendent  aspect of Nihilism or are we stuck in the situation of naturalism that Underhill summarizes so succinctly:  “It says in effect: The room in which we find ourselves is fairly comfortable. Draw the curtains, for the night is dark: and let us devote ourselves to describing  the furniture.”  Is this our reality?

******************"Kierkegaard, and so forth, there  seems to be something missing. Was Nietzsche right when he stated that there was no reason to convince oneself of a 'true world'? Would, or should, Heisman have blown his brains out all over the Harvard library steps if he encountered something more within Nihilism? Maybe. Maybe not.   The claim is that the Nihilistic experience is in part 'mystical'. The groundwork for a wholly Transcendent experience is laid within in the experience of the Nothing of the world which allows for the further possibility of an 'opening up' of the Other. The experience of Nothingness within (and of) the world does not  bring forth any 'concrete' forms of the Other. However, an inexplicable, haunting sensation lingers within, creating a suspicion, intensifying to the point of a  “pushing”, for one to confront the Other by a 'clearing of the path', a ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: nihilism_mystical]]******************

Allowing for only the looming of a suspicion that will not seem to completely fade. The descriptions found in even the most 'profound thinkers' is what we may refer to as the 'diminished' or Worldly",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: nihilism_mystical]]******************
******************"versions of Nihilism, i.e. the Nothing of the world.  There is another aspect of the Nihilistic experience that is seemingly 'beyond', but one is not in a position to say whether this suspicious whisper exists solely within, or whether it is incoherent with, or something totally separate and unrelated from the Worldly form of Nihilism. Regardless of the ascendant nature  of the 'other half'(?) of the experience, this form is even still subsumed by the Nothing of the world. In other words, the 'deeper' experiences of Nihilism that may or may not be entirely worldly are as rarely explored or experienced as its Naturalistic counterpart. With that said, there is a 'wider' experience of Nihilism,  there is a more direct confrontation to be had. This is found in what is normally referred to as the psychedelic experience.   ### (I need to rewrite the above paragraph, as it mentions/describes ""too much"" or goes too far, as it almost foreshadows the consequences of the Transcendent ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: nihilism_mystical]]******************
******************" experience, before it has even happened) The psychedelic experience can be mystical. What is a 'mystical experience'? Broadly stated, the mystical experience eradicates the ego. The worldly 'I' is erased from its entirety, yet there is something that remains. There is a disconnect from the worldly flesh-body that is experienced as wholly  incorporeal. While there is no ego to be found, this 'something' that resembles a 'you' remains; yet this different sort of 'you' is not all there is either. There is a  'bigger something'; there is a meeting with.  Nihilism in its fully Transcendent forms is experienced in such a way that it can be described as an Augmented version of experiencing the Nothing of the world.  The Nothing of the world and the Transcendent experiences of Nihilism are simply variants of each other. The Transcendent form of Nihilism coincides with what is normally labeled as 'mystical'. This Augmented form of Nihilism is a true 'opening up' of the Transcendent. There is",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: nihilism_mystical]]******************
******************"close similarity in the comparison to the 'two-sided' experiences of Nihilism, as Transcendent and as Naturalistic, as is  found within human consciousness as the divided-self as part Transcendent and part Natural. The 'external' appearance of Transcendent Nihilism is one that is indeed taken as an encounter with the Other, while the naturalistic aspect of Nihilism is one that 'hears a 'message' that is coming 'from me and beyond me', yet within the world. And although they differ in pure experience, they are not  in conflict with one another; they lend themselves to each other in a cohesive fashion.     “It is a mistake to supposed that mysticism derives from a softening of the  instincts, from a compromised vitality...To get a sense of them, imagine a Hernando Cortez in the middle of an invisible geography.

It is a phase in the self's growth in contemplation; a bridge which leads from its old  and uncoordinated life of activity to its new unified life of deep action--the real ""mystic life"" of man.” Underhill     “He calls suffering the “gymnastic of eternity,” the “terrible initiative caress of  God”; recognizing in it a quality for which the disagreeable rearrangement of  nerve molecules cannot account. Sometimes, in the excess of his optimism, he puts to the test of practice this theory with all its implications. Refusing to be  deluded by the pleasures of the sense world, he accepts instead of avoiding pain, and becomes an ascetic; a puzzling type for the convinced naturalist, who, falling back upon contempt—that favourite resource of the frustrated reason—can only  regard him as diseased.” Underhill     “Believe me, children, one",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: nihilism_mystical]]******************
******************"who would know much about these high matters  would often have to keep his bed, for his bodily frame could not support it.” Tauler     The Transcendent aspect of the Nihilistic experience stays mostly hidden due to  a lack of participation or pursued confrontation with the Other. Many don't even know that it exists; or if they do, they have misconceptions about it due to the  babble from people who have never experienced it themselves. Most 'spiritual' journeys consists of meditation, contemplation, various mortifications, and so on. Yet, even though these practices are performed with the aim of attaining a mystical experience, most fail at ever achieving this end (at least in such an awe- inspiring fashion).     “In order to go into it, man must empty himself of all the finite contents of his  ordinary life; he must surrender all preliminary concerns for the sake of the ultimate concern.

But is there something more? Is there another way that 'guarantees' a confrontation with the Other?

The real question is this:  what if one 'meets' this Other and still cannot hold to any delusion set forth by other humans who have supposedly gone through this experience, nor develop any symbols that show relevance to the Other? All concrete symbols of Transcendence are dead.   What do we say about this unspeakable world? Is it purely illusory? A misinterpretation of a trick that is played on us by our mind? For one who has  not experienced, this may pass off as an 'explanation'. For those who have experienced the Transcendent forms of Nihilism, it cannot be dismissed so easily.

Buddhists' Emptiness is not on the plane of relativity. It is Absolute Emptiness transcending all forms of mutual relationship, of subject and object, birth and death, God and the world, something and nothing, yes and no, affirmation and negation.

If you are do not reduce yourself into as pure a form humility as one can achieve, if you do not renounce the ego, the self, if you hold on, well, then, you will bring a nightmare upon yourself like never experienced before.  The preparation of renunciation begins with the experiencing the Nothing of the world. One must give up holding onto the deadness of the world. The transitory nature of all things within the world are nothing but distractions that deflect the  Other. What is it to experience oneself as Nothing, if it is not a dissolution of the ego? To renounce worldly desires, ambitions, and any other form of illusion, is to  embrace the Nothing of the world, which allows for a 'clearer' experience of the Other. The dissolution of the 'I' brings forth the greatest sensation of Unity. A feeling of pure consciousness that is One with all of existence; it is pure existence.    “To the extent that there is attachment to 'I,' 'Me,' 'Mine,' there is no attachment ",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: nihilism_mystical]]******************

To allow this enemy to live is in the end to lose everything.” Tozer     “The void- myself without me- is the liquidation of the adventure of the 'I'- it is  being without any trace of being, a blessed engulfment, an incomparable  disaster.” Cioran     “I am sorry sometimes that God",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: nihilism_mystical]]******************

This is not a 'meeting' with another object within the world, this is a  confrontation with Existence itself, in the fullest sense of the term. This confrontation is so different that it can easily push one into a state of panic that  will be unrecognizable. The naturalistic side of the divided-self, the side that pulls us down into the world, turns produces a fear that is unimaginable. The 'Hellish' confrontation with the Other, the terrifying bliss of the experience, is  something that cannot be boxed away within human language or dismissed as illusory or 'natural'.     “Some people talk as if meeting the gaze of absolute goodness would be fun.  They need to think again.” C. S.

It is an overwhelming frisson which convulses nothingness, an invasion of being in absolute  emptiness.” Cioran     Is there a way to 'guide' oneself through this confrontation? Music, with its  abstract nature, is suited best for such a journey. For assistance with the death of  the 'I', to release from the naturalistic side of the self, the abstract nature of music, with its strange use of plucking sounds from 'nowhere' with the equally important 'rests' in between each note, as a form of language, allows one to more- fully dispense with the natural-self. Music without words will do best, since any human voice may cause a distraction and pull one down and away from the Other.

The totality is present even in  the broken pieces. More clearly present, perhaps, than in a completely coherent work. At least you aren’t lulled into a sense of false security by some merely  human, merely fabricated order. You have to rely on your immediate perception of the ultimate order.

Bach is divine...” Cioran     “Listening to Bach, one sees God come into being. His music generates divinity.  After a Bach...one feels that God must exists.

From the standpoint of this musical materialism, as one of the most  extreme implications of an unadulterated materialism, lay a possible solution to dominance of my own  analytic and objective tendency to materialize everything.

Bach counters my material self-consistency and its  tendency towards self-decomposition  with a form of holistic-mind order.” Heisman     Plato describes Transcendent Nihilism and the seemingly 'true' mindset to have  in the face of this Nothing:     “...the entire soul is pierced and maddened and pained, and at the recollection of  beauty is again delighted. And from both of them together the soul is oppressed at the strangeness of her condition, and is in a great strait and excitement, and in  her madness can neither sleep by night nor abide in her place by day. And wherever she thinks that she will behold the beautiful one, thither in her desire she runs.

How does one begin to interpret this experience that no words can grasp? The world's religions may be of some help, but they can never  settle the issue. Is there some language that can be developed in order to help one properly address the Nothing? Huxley sums up this need quite well:     “...the ultimate Reality is not clearly and immediately apprehended, except by  those who have made themselves loving, pure in heart and poor in spirit. This  being so, it is hardly surprising that a theology based upon the experience of nice, ordinary, unregenerate people should carry so little conviction. This kind of empirical theology is on precisely the same footing as an empirical astronomy, based upon the experience of naked-eye observers.”     Philosophy, or conceptual thinking, seems to help pave the way to allow for a ",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: nihilism_mystical]]******************

The non-movement as a result of a total lack of values, of an utter insignificance of the human world, goes hand in hand with a Quietist contemplative existence within the Nothing of the world.  Why is it that the psychedelic experience is one which ushers in a mystical experience that confirms the meaninglessness of the world?     “...whilst in that state of abstraction rising higher, perceiving there is a place  beyond any bodily condition, adding still and persevering further in practising wisdom, rejecting this fourth dhyâna, firmly resolved to persevere in the search,  still contriving to put away every desire after form, gradually from every pore of the body there is perceived a feeling of empty release,",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: nihilism_mystical]]******************

This is not about belief or developing a system or trying to box in Nihilism. One  must accept the utter mystery behind Nihilism as something too 'powerful' to be confined in the finite. There is only the Infinite Conclusion.

Like things in a five-and-ten.” And all this shoddiness existed in a closed, cramped universe. “It’s as though one were below  decks in a ship,” I said. “A five-and-ten-cent ship.” And as I looked, it became very clear that this five-and-ten-cent ship was in some way connected with  human pretensions, with the portrait of Cézanne, with A.B. among the Dolomites overacting his favorite character in fiction. This suffocating interior of a dimestore ship was my own personal self; these gimcrack mobiles of tin and plastic  were my personal contributions to the universe.”  Why is this important?

Molinos further states: “But the happy Soul which is gotten to this holy hatred of it self, lives  overwhelmed, drowned and swallowed up in the depth of its own Nothing.”  Within mystical experiences human truth, better put, human rationality is no longer a concern. There are 'things' that are brought forth that no human  language can describe, that no human being can fully comprehend.

Huxley describes a part of his psychedelic experience as follows: “And then t here is the horror of infinity...I found myself all at once on the brink of panic. This, I suddenly felt, was going too far. Too far, even though the going was into  intenser beauty, deeper significance. The fear, as I analyze it in retrospect, was of being overwhelmed, of disintegrating under a pressure of reality greater than a  mind, accustomed to living most of the time in a cosy world of symbols, could possibly bear.

This does not prove  anything. While one is tempted to refer to the psychedelic experience as an encounter with the Other, with all its Transcendent, noetic, and paradoxical  qualities, there is no explicit contradiction in reducing the experience down to a naturalist interpretation.

Plato/Socrates“Few only retain an adequate remembrance of them; and they, when they behold here any image of that other world, are rapt in amazement, but they are ignorant  of what this rapture means, because they do not clearly perceive.

******************" light of justice or temperance or any of the higher ideas which are precious to souls in the earthly copies of them: they are seen through a glass dimly; and there are few who, going to the images, behold in them the realities, and these  only with difficulty.” “The lovers of knowledge are conscious that the soul was simply fastened and glued to the body—until philosophy received her, she could only view real existence through the bars of a prison, not in and through herself...” Phaedo- “...I desire to prove to you that the real philosopher has reason to be of good cheer when he is about to die, and that after death he may hope to obtain  the greatest good in the other world...For I deem that the true votary of philosophy is likely to be misunderstood by other men; they do not perceive that he is always pursuing death and dying; and if this be so, and he has had the desire of death all his life long, why when his time comes should he repine at that which he has been always pursuing",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: nihilism_mystical]]******************
******************"and desiring?” “...the rest of the world are of opinion that to him who has no sense of pleasure and no part in bodily pleasure, life is not worth having; and that he who is indifferent about them is as good as dead.” Look into quotes from St. Theresa Journal- pg. 166” I should use this section on mysticism to really focus on Cioran, specifically On the Heights of Despair and Tears and Saints and Molinos. He has the most  'atheistic' mystical language and there are so many quotes and great descriptions of what I am attempting to put forth. The need to 'promote' the 'true' religious  mindset found in Cioran, who is normally labeled as a 'nihilist'. This needs to be dispelled. This section will highlight 'Nihiltheism' that is not grounded 'simply' ",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: nihilism_mystical]]******************
******************" in saints or other 'Christian' or 'religious' context. Huxley and Smith is a good start, since they work from a psychedelic viewpoint, rather than a explicitly 'religious'. Use Cioran's quotes for mysticism in this section, but keep in mind his  ideas on 'madness' or mental health for the 'Suicide' section. “Where, for any reason, physical or moral, the psychological dispositions are unsatisfactory, the removal of obstacles by a drug or by ascetic practices will result in a negative rather than a positive spiritual experience. Such an infernal  experience is extremely distressing, but may also be extremely salutary. There are plenty of people to whom a few hours in hell— the hell that they themselves have done so much to create— could do a world of good.” Huxley The same experience of Nihilism- the Nothing of the world is a diminished variant of the Transcendent version. Nothingness is just the dissolution of the 'I', of the ego. The ego fears the Other. “The instant cure of most of",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: nihilism_mystical]]******************
******************"our religious ills would be to enter the Presence in spiritual experience, to become suddenly aware that we are in God and that God is in us.”  Tozer “I am sorry sometimes that God no longer fills us with dread. If only we could feel again the primordial quiver of dread in front of the unknown!” Cioran “How desist from what we shall never recover, from that pathetic and unheard of nothing which bears our name...we can vanquish it only by means of a sudden whirlwind which, sweeping away the ego, leaves us alone, without anyone,  without ourselves...” Cioran",[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[pdf: nihilism_mystical]]******************
******************" “Through psychedelics we are learning that God is not an idea, God is a lost continent in the human mind.” Mckenna “He gave us two words: one is intellectual knowledge, and the other is realization. That is to say, intellectual assent is within this realization, and realization is beyond it. Therefore intellectual assent is not sufficient. Every man  can say this theory is right, but that is not realization; he must realize it. We can all say we understand that this is hypnotism, but that is not realization. That will  be when the hypnotism will break — even for a moment. It will come in a flash; it must come. If you struggle it will come.” Vivekananda “...the infinite distance of the finite from the infinite and, consequently, the negative judgment over any finite attempts to reach the infinite. The feeling of being consumed in the presence of the divine is a profound expression of man's relation to the holy.” Tillich “then you will think it useless to express an opinion, to take a",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: nihilism_mystical]]******************
******************"stand, to make an impression; the noises you have renounced increase the anxiety of your soul. after having struggled madly to solve all problems, after having suffered on the heights of despair, in the supreme hour of revelation, you will find that the only answer, the only reality, is silence.” Cioran “And once our egos have been deposed, what would be left of us? By all recorded accounts, everything would be left except what Horwitz called “a vanity, an elaborate delusion, a ruse.” Ligotti “Regardless of the life stories of U. G., Wren-Lewis, and Suzanne Segal, egodeath is a state that has nothing but anecdotal evidence to support it, which groups this phenomenon with mystical experiences and revealed religions.” ",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: nihilism_mystical]]******************
******************" Ligotti (this is an important quote which demands pessimism. No direct experience of the Other, regardless if it is still illusory or within the 'mind', and one is left with only the Nothing of the world) “...'the tragedy of the ego.' This phrase fits like a glove into Zapffe’s theory of consciousness as a tragic blunder. Disappointingly, Metzinger goes on to say that  “the tragedy of the ego dissolves because nobody is ever born and nobody ever dies.” This statement is borrowed from Zen Buddhism (the Heart Sutra) and  loses something when translated from a monastery to a university lecture hall.” Ligotti The 27th of August is when I experienced something Other. What an amazing experience! Understanding, mystery, out of body, fear, humility, and on and on. The entire universe dissolved before my very eyes. I have never experienced anything like it. The sky, the ocean, Bach! What an amazing sort of experience that I cannot imagine not experiencing. Bach uses the language of music,",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: nihilism_mystical]]******************
******************"which  is God's language, in order to explain the universe to me. The details are for further exploration, but Naturalism seems to be wholly defeated by my experience. I could say that it was simply “me”, but this does not seem to be a possibility. I want my last breath to be the same breath that is stolen from me when I fully experience Bach. As insignificant as this brilliant piece of music is, with it's illusory nature of omnipotence, which screams from a containment within even the most advanced architecture of man, only goes to show how unremarkable  even the greatest of human achievements appear when placed against the backdrop of the Infinite. “Mysticism...is unsatisfactory in moral content. The ultimate reality of the world ",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: nihilism_mystical]]******************
******************" is not moral ('God is not good') and the mystic who unites himself with ultimate reality is uniting himself with a non-moral being, therefore he is not moral.” Huxley (this is very important, Nihiltheism, must be worked into the writing) “The general acceptance of a doctrine that denies meaning and value to the world as a whole, while assigning them in a supreme degree to certain arbitrarily  selected parts of the totality, can only have evil and disastrous results...We have thought of ourselves as members of supremely meaningful and valuable  communities – deified nations, divine classes and what not – existing within a meaningless universe.” Huxley (just putting this here in order not to forget it. It doesn't belong with mysticism, but it's a strong quote) “...ego-death is a state that has nothing but anecdotal evidence to support it, which groups this phenomenon with mystical experiences and revealed religions.” Ligotti “A generation ago, in the psychedelic era, people opened",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: nihilism_mystical]]******************

******************"Through the lens of Cioran, we find a nexus where nihilism's confrontation with language mirrors the existential quest for meaning amidst nothingness. This intersection breeds a paradox: seeking purpose in a world perceived as devoid of it, underpinned by an embrace of life's inherent absurdities. Cioran's reflections pivot around this confluence, illustrating how our understanding and confrontation with existential despair could lead to either a nihilistic surrender or a transcendent revaluation of life within the void.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[ai facts]]******************

******************" You’ve Ruined My Life, Professor Craig Dear Professor Craig, My name is Adam. I am an atheist, and have been one ever since I can remember. I was brought up in the Roman Catholic church, but could never really say that I held any theistic beliefs with any sincerity. For instance, one time, when I was around eight or nine years old, I asked a nun at my church where I ""was"" before I was born. She responded: ""You were with God."" I was still curious, so I asked her how long I was with God, before my being born, and she proclaimed: ""For an eternity!"" I then asked her why I could not remember ""existing with God” for an eternity of time (is an eternity of time even a coherent concept?). She had enough with that question and proceeded to shew me away to play with the other children. Looking back, I am proud of my skeptical disposition. Let's skip ahead a little bit. I found philosophy and I fell in love with it. I transferred schools in order to obtain my BA. Almost all of the papers I wrote",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],"[[pdf: you’ve ruined my life, profess]]"******************

Moreover, I was practically an ""evangelical"" atheist, proclaiming the good word of rationality! My beliefs were strident at best, and intolerant at worst. I thought I had the ""God question"" all figured out. It was a settled issue for me: God did not exist. The philosophy of religion was my initial and main draw to philosophy, but I soon found myself wanting to explore philosophy in all its glory. Philosophy, as a whole, was too interesting to just ""stop"", then move on to some ""real job"". I decided to apply to an MA program in philosophy at CSULA, and got accepted. Philosophy was something that I took very seriously. So much so, that I drove from NY to CA",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],"[[pdf: you’ve ruined my life, profess]]"******************

I actually wrote a response to your paper The Absurdity of Life Without God and used it as my writing sample in order to get in to CSULA. I stayed up for months writing and polishing my responses to your claims of the inconsistency of atheism in its response to meaning, value, and purpose in life. I had too. You were telling me my life, as a direct result of my worldview, was worthless in every possible way. Well, as an ambitious philosophy student, I could not simply let you get away this. Your objections to atheism needed answers. And after wrestling with your paper for some time, I actually felt pretty good about the end product and presumed to have ""answered"" your objections to atheism in a satisfactory way. I could now move on, live my life with the excitement, consistency, and appreciation that I had before reading your essay. I was wrong.

Let me mention here that I was a huge fan of the New Atheists, but I always sensed something was askew with them. Something seemed off about them because whenever they were talking about meaning, value, or purpose, they answered in such ways that only a person ignorant of the objections in your paper could respond. In short (too late), your paper never left my mind, even years after I wrote a ""response"" to it. I knew, deep down, that not only did I not, but could not answer your objections to atheism.

I have seen every debate you have ever recorded and put up on the internet. I watch all your lectures and talks (Closer to Truth, youtube, etc.) I think you are the epitome of what a philosopher should be. You're uber logical, fantastically clear, and ""computeresk"" with the speed and precision of your responses to objections against your position, particularly the criticisms you respond to in your debates. For a long time now, I have wanted to be a philosopher as you are a philosopher. I want to have an argument posed against my position, and be able to dissect it in the same manner as you do. I can honestly say that I have learned more from reading what you have wrote and watching you on the internet than maybe all of my years in school, formally studying philosophy. I seem to owe you a lot, with regards to my philosophical",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],"[[pdf: you’ve ruined my life, profess]]"******************
******************"development, at least. Now, let's get down to business and why exactly it is that you have ruined my life. After reading your paper on the absurdity of life without God, I soon realized that I had to become a nihilist. To act otherwise would inevitably reduce into an inconsistency. Nihilism is the logical conclusion of an atheistic worldview. Yet, nihilism is unlivable. Christopher Hitchens used to say that you cannot derive any knowledge of what an atheist believes from the fact that she is an atheist. If someone claims to be an atheist, according to Hitchens, you can only conclude that she believes that ""God does not exist"" or that she ""lacks a belief in God"" (don't get me started with that",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],"[[pdf: you’ve ruined my life, profess]]"******************
******************" distinction!!!) You cannot “go any further” and know if she is a Marxist or a Capitalist, etc. But your paper shows that Hitchens is patently false about this. Atheism necessarily entails nihilistic conclusions about certain questions, particularly those you bring up in your paper about meaning, value, and purpose. There is a similar misunderstanding that shows how atheists fail to fully comprehend the severity of their own worldview. I feel like I need to say how disappointed I am in the New Atheists, and moreover, the professional philosophers, who do not understand the ""moral argument"" for God's existence. Why can't they comprehend the ontology of values? Why is this so difficult? It is all too obvious that you are not talking about whether people can act, or know of the, ""good"" on atheism, but rather that there is no foundation for morality outside of God. Sorry, I just had to rant a little, because it bothers me when philosophers, who should know better, don't comprehend the",[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],"[[pdf: you’ve ruined my life, profess]]"******************

People don't even understand how well thought out your views are. You have the most coherent worldview I have ever heard anyone describe. Sorry, just wanted to say that you have at least one atheist on your side, sir. So, this brings me to the problem (finally, sorry)- Philosophically, I agree with almost everything you say. Not in a “follower” sense, but in that I find what you say either convincingly true or I find I come to the same conclusions that you do with regards to particular ideas that I have reasoned through on my own. With that said, I am still an atheist. How is this possible? How could my favorite philosopher be a Christian, I agree with almost",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],"[[pdf: you’ve ruined my life, profess]]"******************
******************" everything he says, yet I am an atheist? Well, it seems that you make an extremely strong case for the rationality of an “abstract” notion of God, but I cannot get myself to go the extra step further and believe any of the world religions (not that I believe this abstract God actually exists either, it just seems to be becoming more and more plausible to me). I definitely cannot get myself to be a Christian. Christianity just does not seem true to me. However, the deeper I dive into philosophy, the more the theistic worldview seems more plausible. The concepts or “language” of mathematics seems to “cry out” as you put it for an explanation, objective moral values seem to be real (but they can't be “real”, if atheism is true), the idea of ""existence"" nauseates me to no end (just the thought of anything, at all, existing, and especially existing without any reason, frightens me,), and I could go on and on.

******************"when I don't think about the arguments, and I think about what you and others have said about the “Holy Spirit”, I cannot get myself to believe that this “Holy Spirit” exists and can authenticate my belief in God. As you know, Martin Luther thought the Holy Spirit would guide people in reading the Bible properly, when the Reformation was underway, since there was the concern that without the guidance of the church, people may interpret the bible incorrectly. The Holy Spirit's guiding capabilities seem to be have been proven empirically false though, due to such a wide variety of conflicting beliefs all being derived from the Bible. Now I know that the diversity of beliefs doesn't necessarily allow for the conclusion that all of the religious beliefs or experiences are false, that there aren't at least some beliefs or experiences that are true, and therefore the Holy Spirit does not exist.

There does not seem to be anything here to help me out of the nihilistic rut. Lately though, I have been questioning why I even value “rationality”, or what it even means to “value” rationality on an atheistic worldview. That's another topic though, sorry. Let me wrap this ramble up. I am now stuck in a nihilistic-atheistic world that I hate. Agnosticism is not even a coherent position to me, with regards to a Perfect Being, since I believe that the greatest conceivable being could give me knowledge of its existence, if it wanted to. Theism is a dream come true. The world would make sense, the existential mysteries that haunt me would be solved, life would be livable. It is atheism, however, which seems to be true, yet I do not want to live like this. I have become depressed to no end. I have",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],"[[pdf: you’ve ruined my life, profess]]"******************

This letter is as sincere as it gets. You may be my last hope. Since I agree with you on so much, I was hoping you would have the answer to this. I know the “answer” is Christianity, but as I said, I cannot get myself to believe its truth.  I am an atheist who hates atheism. I want there to be a God more than anything, yet I cannot get myself to believe in one. I cannot seem to give an adequate answer to Camus's question: “Is life worth living?” A feel like a philosopher of your caliber is the only person I have left to turn to.

******************" it is so encouraging to get a letter like yours! You have seen through the fog of often hateful rhetoric to discern the real issues. Your story reminds me so much of C. S. Lewis, who, as a scientific naturalist, found everything that he thought was real to be meaningless and unfulfilling, and everything he loved, such as myth, legend, and fantasy, to be imaginary and unreal. Like you, Lewis approached Christ gradually, shedding first his naturalism and then later his scepticism about Jesus of Nazareth. Lewis finally broke the bonds of the naturalism that had bound him, discovering in Christ the “true myth,” the fusion of rationality and imagination. Once you free yourself of your atheism, you’ll find the next step to Christian theism a relatively short one. You mention your scepticism about Luther’s belief that the Holy Spirit “would guide people in reading the Bible properly,” for “The Holy Spirit's guiding capabilities seem to be have been proven empirically false. . . , due to",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],"[[pdf: you’ve ruined my life, profess]]"******************
******************"such a wide variety of conflicting beliefs all being derived from the Bible.” Now I don’t subscribe to the belief you attribute to Luther; nevertheless, the argument you offer against it does not strike me as a good one. In order to prevent a plethora of divergent interpretations, what would be required is, not just that Holy Spirit would guide people into the truth, but that Holy Spirit would intervene to prevent aberrant interpretations of the Bible as well, and Luther never claimed that He does that. If Luther is right, one would expect to find people adhering to a correct interpretation and others departing from the true way and propounding deviant interpretations, which is exactly what we do find. Luther’s view would be falsified only if everyone departed from the truth.

While this entails the truth of certain core Christian claims, it does not guarantee proper interpretation of biblical passages.

I think you already discern the weakness of your objection, for you say, “I know that the diversity of beliefs doesn't necessarily allow for the conclusion that all of the religious beliefs or experiences are false, that there aren't at least some beliefs or experiences that are true, and therefore the Holy Spirit does not exist.” Right; you need to be open to the convicting witness of the Spirit in your life that you need God’s forgiveness and cleansing for your moral failures.

So I think faith in Jesus is historically quite well-founded. So now we come to the million dollar question: “What would YOU suggest I do?” I take this question very seriously. So here’s what I suggest you do:  Read C. S. Lewis’ book Surprised by Joy. I think you will resonate with Lewis’ struggle, both to free himself of atheism and then of his scepticism about Christian faith.  Seek experiences that put you in touch with the transcendent. You need to escape the cloying bonds of naturalism by catching glimpses of a transcendent reality beyond the material world. This will help to prepare your heart for belief in God. So open yourself to experiences of sublime beauty. Listen to Schumann’s Träumerei, to Dvorak’s New World Symphony, to Rimsky-Korsakov’s Scheherazade, and so on.

******************"   LexRENSum Summary:  The Religious Experience of Nihilism   -Nihilism Preface-  Part 1: Introduction to Nihilism   The document begins with a preface that positions itself as an exploration of nihilism—a philosophical viewpoint that denies the existence of intrinsic  meaning, purpose, or value in life. It challenges the conventional understandings of nihilism found in mainstream philosophy, aiming to offer a new interpretation  that feels more authentic to the author's personal experience.  The writer emphasizes a non-traditional approach by extensively quoting from various thinkers without feeling the need to defend this method. The quotes are intended to show different perspectives converging towards a single, unified  insight into the experience of nihilism. The author expresses a desire for their own voice to be lost among these citations, implying that the message is more  significant than the messenger.  Part 2: The Nature of the Individual's Experience   The author delves",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************

However, doubt remains a prominent feature in ",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************

The document reveals the intention to vary tones and potentially give the impression of multiple authors being involved, which reflects the multifaceted nature of the subject matter and the author's own internal conflicts and diversity  of thought.  Part 3: Philosophical Quotes and Their Role    The author continues to weave in quotes from different philosophers and thinkers, using their ideas to underscore the complexity of the human condition  and the struggle to find meaning. These quotes serve to illustrate the shared insights of various philosophers, suggesting an underlying unity in their  descriptions of existential experiences.  The inclusion of these quotes is meant to demonstrate that regardless of the diverse backgrounds or labels of the thinkers—whether they are Christian, Hindu, Nihilist, or otherwise—their",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"experiences and articulations of nihilism are fundamentally similar.  Part 4: The Author's Stance on Knowledge and Scholarly Work   The author criticizes traditional academia and the pursuit of 'scholarly' work, suggesting that the quest for knowledge or pride in one's intellectual accomplishments is misguided. They argue that true philosophy is an ongoing,  never-completed process of questioning and exploration, akin to a ""story"" rather than a concluded argument. ",[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   Part 5: Nihilism as Inescapable Truth   In this section, the author suggests that nihilism is the only 'truth' that can be universally experienced or 'known' by humans, as it does not offer answers but  rather represents the lack of them. The experience of nihilism is depicted as something that cuts through the fabric of all human convictions, revealing the  absence of ultimate knowledge or paths to follow. It is portrayed as unavoidable, inherent in every human life, whether acknowledged or not.  Part 6: Philosophical Quotes on Nihilism and Existence   The draH continues to interlace philosophical quotes that touch on topics like the fear of nothingness, the nature of anxiety, and the illusion of certainty and knowledge. These quotes further establish nihilism as an existential baseline—a  default state that underlies all human experience and thought. The philosophers cited seem to grapple with the same issues, despite the varied lexicons and  cultural contexts from which they",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************

Part 7: Critiques and Personal Reflections   The author anticipates criticisms of their work, acknowledging that because the experience of nihilism is rare, any critiques are likely to miss the mark. They assert their intention to report experiences without censorship, even if that  involves contradicting established views or themselves. The text implies that the author seeks no validation or approval for their thoughts, instead aligning  themselves with the quoted thinkers as equals in their confrontation with nihilism.

The author seems to question the authenticity of those who claim authority without the  profound personal experience to back it up.  Part 9: Conclusion and Acknowledgment of Nihilism's Complexity    The author concludes by reiterating the complexity of nihilism and its resistance to simplification. They express skepticism about the value of their own writing  and the act of writing in general, as well as a desire to make others uncomfortable and to challenge them to confront the abyss of existence.

******************"concepts discussed in the main text, such as reflections on the nature of despair, the concept of immortality, and the universal aspects of  nihilism. These notes seem to serve as a reservoir of ideas for expanding the main text.  Part 10: Immortality and the Afterlife   The author challenges traditional notions of immortality and the afterlife, arguing that seeking eternal life or heaven often reflects a naïve faith or a misunderstanding of the human condition. The document cites thinkers who ",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   express skepticism about the coherence of the world and the plausibility of an afterlife that merely extends earthly experiences into infinity. Instead, the author implies that such immortality concepts fail to address the deeper existential  problems that nihilism exposes.  Part 11: Universal Experience of Nihilism    The author incorporates quotes that emphasize the universality of nihilism, suggesting that all people, knowingly or unknowingly, experience despair—a  central theme in nihilist thought. This despair is not tied to any particular life event or situation but is an inherent part of the human condition, a consequence  of our confrontation with existence itself.  Part 12: The Illusion of Simple Salvation    In the final portion of the notes, the idea of simple salvation is explored. The document questions the possibility of achieving an easy resolution to the  complex issues raised by nihilism, suggesting that such an attempt would be futile.

Part 13: The Individual's Search for Meaning    The document culminates by encouraging an individual approach to religion and philosophy, one where personal insights remain private and sacred. The author  stresses the importance of seeking one's own understanding rather than blindly following established doctrines. This pursuit of personal meaning is juxtaposed ",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   with the societal pressure to conform and the disillusionment that can arise when acknowledging the depth of existential despair.  Conclusion   Overall, the document presents a deep dive into nihilism, as both a philosophical concept and a personal experience. It is rich with quotes and reflections that  span centuries and cultures, yet coalesce around the central theme of meaninglessness. The author's writing is both an exploration and a confession, a  testament of the struggle between the desire for truth and the acceptance of the intrinsic unknowability inherent to human existence. It is not so much a  systematic study but more a narrative journey through the various landscapes of nihilist thought.

Philosophy and Life's Significance: The text opens by questioning the significance of life and philosophical inquiry. It references Cicero's belief that philosophy prepares one for death and Heidegger's thoughts on being struck by the  strangeness of existence, which leads to the fundamental ""Why?"" of life.  Human Activity and Meaninglessness: The idea that human actions are ultimately meaningless is presented. The text suggests that much of what drives human behavior—our goals and distractions—are rooted in an ignorance of nihilism. The  breakdown of these distractions can force one to confront nihilism directly, raising questions about the rationality of suicide, the possibility of living with a  sense of Nothingness, and the potential for a religious experience or philosophy that can incorporate this sense of nothing.

It argues that philosophy has lost touch with the profound questions of  existence due to an overemphasis on analytic reasoning.  The Scholar's Dilemma: There is a portrayal of scholars as people who can't think independently but merely react to pre-existing thoughts, echoing Nietzsche's criticism of academia. The text suggests that scholars lack original thought and  are trapped by their dependence on the ideas of others. ",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************

Religious Philosophy and Its Shortcomings: Religious philosophers are criticized for offering weak defenses of their beliefs and for not engaging deeply enough with skepticism. This is linked to the notion that philosophy has strayed from its  Socratic roots, which were more inquisitive and less concerned with providing definite answers.  Part 3: Existential Conditions and Philosophy's Potential Existential Disillusionment: The text discusses how, when the veneer of life's immediate concerns is stripped away, individuals may confront a profound sense of disillusionment and the   meaninglessness of their achievements in the face of death and the vastness of time.  Philosophy's Limitations and",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"Death: The draft continues to argue that philosophy, in its traditional form, cannot fully address the human confrontation with death. It suggests that most philosophies dodge the issue of mortality and  fail to acknowledge the transformative impact of facing one's finitude.  Philosophy as Interpretation: The author posits that philosophy should not be seen as a provider of definitive truths but rather as a method to interpret and explain existence. This interpretation leads to the conclusion that philosophy ",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   should aim to create a 'map of consequences' derived from the direct human experience of nihilism.  Confronting the Void of Existence: A significant portion of the document focuses on the existential experience of facing the 'Nothing'—the realization that life may have no inherent meaning. This encounter with nothingness is described as a  transformative, albeit rare, event that can shake an individual's worldview to its core.  Part 4: Addressing the Experience of Nihilism Constructive Content of Nihilism: The draH explores whether within the desolate landscape of nihilism, there might be a kernel of constructive content—a 'message' or a transformative insight— despite its fundamentally destructive  nature. It ponders the possibility of interpreting this experience in a way that isn't purely negative.

******************"   Re-defining 'Religious' Experience: The text calls for a redefinition or avoidance of the term 'religious' due to its various connotations and instead suggests using 'Transcendence' to describe experiences that reach beyond mundane existence.  Part 5: Nihilism and Transcendence  Transcendence and Nihilism: The text posits that experiences of nihilism, with their deconstructive qualities, may actually lay the groundwork for  transcendence—a state of being that goes beyond the physical or material aspects of life. This state is not necessarily religious in the traditional sense but is  an acknowledgment of something that is ""Wholly-Other.""

It posits that even though nihilism is a universal undercurrent, the direct  and transformative experience of it is rare.  Part 6: Implications and Paths Forward  The Rarity of Nihilistic Experiences: The text suggests that the reason full encounters with nihilism are rare is due to an instinctual or conscious inclination to engage with the world. This engagement masks the underlying nothingness,  allowing individuals to feel they are living meaningful lives despite the potential absence of intrinsic meaning.  Madness, Suicide, and the Other: The author then touches on the potential outcomes of facing nihilism: madness, suicide, or a turn towards the Other (which could represent a form of transcendence or ultimate reality).

Philosophy's Limitations and Contributions: Philosophy is seen as having the potential to contribute to understanding nihilism if it can move beyond  traditional frameworks and engage directly with human experiences of nothingness. The document argues for a philosophy rooted in the lived  experience rather than abstract theorization.  The Struggle with Nothingness: The draH considers the struggle with nothingness as a defining aspect of human existence. It weighs the possibility that this ,[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   struggle may contain a hidden message or revelation that could reshape one's understanding of life.  The Inevitability of Nihilism: Finally, the document contends that there is no ultimate escape from nihilism; it is an ever-present reality beneath the surface of existence. It challenges readers to consider how one might authentically engage  with this reality and potentially find a path through it that does not lead to despair.  --- Summary:  The Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism   -Awaken, Material Nightmare- Part 1: Introduction and the Philosophical Dilemma  Your document begins with an exploration of the struggle between traditional religious belief and a modern understanding that might exclude the presence of a divine entity or ultimate reality.

******************"   absurdity of life—but instead of confronting it, they turn away and distract themselves with various activities. This turning away is likened to an ""always falling"" condition, tied to Western and Christian cultural constructs such as  'original sin' or scientific reductions of consciousness to mere accidents. This results in a ""divided-self"" where one is torn between engaging with the  finite, material world and the pursuit of something infinite or transcendent.   This divided-self is depicted as inescapable and pervasive, influencing how people react to the world and their place within it. Through various philosophical and religious quotes, the draH illustrates the inner conflict that  arises from this condition. The implication is that most people settle for superficial solutions to this conflict, avoiding genuine engagement with the  philosophical and existential questions that arise from this divided state of being.  Part 2: The Nature of Despair and Religious Perspectives The",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************

It's argued that despite moments of clarity, existence tends to dominate us with its mundane demands, leading to a life of distraction  rather than true engagement with our ""authentic self."" The text posits that the mundane life is one of inauthenticity, a sort of patchwork  existence that covers up the underlying despair and meaninglessness.  Several religious perspectives are brought into the conversation, suggesting that genuine religiosity involves a profound dissatisfaction with the world ",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   and a renunciation of its superficialities. This renunciation is not an intellectual exercise but a lived experience of turning away from the world— a common thread in many mystical traditions, like those of Christianity,  Buddhism, and Taoism. The discussion highlights the struggle between the worldly and the spiritual.  Part 3: The Allure of Naturalism and the Experience of Guilt  The draH delves into the tension between naturalism—the focus on the material and finite world—and the pull toward something beyond this, a Transcendent aspect of reality. The writers cited in your document describe  humanity's recurrent fall back into the concerns of the finite world, a condition that oHen leaves people with a sense of guilt. This guilt isn't  necessarily about failing others but is an internal struggle, a frustration with one's inability to live authentically or to realize a ""True Self"" that is more  than just the sum of naturalistic impulses.   Heidegger is referenced to articulate a",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"more existential understanding of guilt, one that is an essential part of being and arising from our natural  tendency to be absorbed by the world rather than being authentically ourselves. Guilt, in this sense, is not about social or moral failings but about  the failure to recognize and actualize our deepest potentialities.  Part 4: The Human Condition and Renunciation of the World   The text moves on to discuss the idea of renunciation as a response to the divided nature of human consciousness. It suggests that only those who  have seen the illusory nature of material concerns and worldly attachments ",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   can truly grasp the human condition. This understanding oHen leads to a negative or non-action-oriented approach to life, where the focus shiHs from external actions to internal realization.  Various religious and philosophical figures are cited to support this idea, including Vivekananda, who criticizes the materialistic interpretation of action- oriented religion. The draH also brings in Luther and other thinkers to emphasize the point that true faith and spirituality may involve a fundamental detachment  from the world and its transient concerns.  Part 5: Nihilism, Indifference, and Participation   The document further explores the concept of Nihilism and how it represents an ultimate confrontation with the meaninglessness of existence.  Rather than proposing solutions, Nihilism compels individuals to face the abyss, leading to either indifference or a radical form of participation that  grapples with the void itself.

Part 6: Worldly Meaning vs. Transcendental Significance  As the draH continues, it contrasts the overwhelming draw of worldly meaning with the potential for a Transcendental perspective.

******************"   suggesting that these are merely distractions from the harsh reality of existence.   The text references thinkers like Huxley, who critique the modern tendency to place undue importance on progress and human achievement, suggesting that this perspective leads to a distorted understanding of reality. The  argument unfolds around the idea that true liberation from the horrors of existence comes not from the attachment to worldly concerns but from a  profound realization of the world's unreality.  Part 7: The Problem of Inauthentic Living and the Role of Nihilism   The draH posits that many people live inauthentically, ignoring the despair and meaninglessness that underpin human existence. Nihilism is seen as a  destructive force that cannot be easily reconciled with a return to normal life once it has been fully realized; the world becomes transparent and dead to  those who experience it.

Instead, the draH argues for an empirical engagement with the phenomena of existence, like  uncanniness and mystical experiences, to open up a different level of understanding that goes beyond intellectual theorizing.   Throughout, the draH emphasizes the need for a philosophical approach that remains open to the questions and mysteries inherent in being human. By  comparing the casual acceptance of existence to the profound sense of ""cosmic panic"" that some argue is central to the human experience, the  draH indicates that a truly philosophical outlook must grapple with the absurdity",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************

Part 9: The Role of Doubt and Skepticism   In exploring the depths of doubt and skepticism, the draH highlights how they are not only integral to the experience of Nihilism but can also serve as  a pathway to a more profound understanding of existence. It acknowledges that while mystical and transcendent experiences may offer a glimpse into a  larger reality, they too are ultimately insufficient in the face of the inexorable pull of meaninglessness.

The draH questions whether this proposed courage is a genuine confrontation with Nihilism or a means of retreating from it. The  text suggests that true courage might lie not in facing the world but in acknowledging the futility of doing so.   The draH concludes by suggesting that the existential challenge is not to find meaning or happiness within the world but to confront the reality of its  absence. It offers a somber perspective that sees the human condition as one of inevitable disillusionment with the world and a constant struggle to  make sense of a life that is ultimately without inherent purpose or value.

******************"   -The Suicide of the Renouncer- Part 1: Introduction to Nihilism  The essay begins by examining the concept of Nihilism and its impact on human consciousness and behavior. Nihilism is essentially the belief in the absence of inherent meaning in life. The author quotes a variety of thinkers  who have touched upon existential themes, from the despair and madness that can arise from a deep understanding of human existence to the  potential healing that such an understanding might also bring.   The central question posed is whether the full acknowledgement of Nihilism necessarily leads to madness or suicide, or if it can be a path to a different kind of transcendence. The author suggests that while Nihilism can be  distinguished from mental illness, it can still lead to profound psychological distress. This distress manifests as a confrontation with the void, or the  nothingness, that underlies the façade of everyday life.  Part 2: Madness, Suicide, and Their Relation to Nihilism  The",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"essay proceeds to explore how madness and suicide relate to Nihilism. It questions whether these are inevitable outcomes for those who deeply internalize a nihilistic worldview. The writing delves into historical and  philosophical figures who have grappled with the despair of Nihilism, and whether or not madness is a state to be embraced as a form of deeper  insight or rejected as a destructive end. ",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"    A specific case is mentioned – that of Mitchell Heisman, a man who committed suicide aHer writing a 2,000-page manifesto on Nihilism. His act is used to illustrate the potential extremes of a nihilistic perspective, raising  the question of whether there can be a rational justification for suicide in a world perceived as inherently irrational.  Part 3: The Search for Authenticity in Nihilism  The essay then confronts the topic of authenticity, particularly in the context of suicide. It differentiates between what might be considered ""worldly"" suicide, driven by loss or failure in life's pursuits, and ""nihilistic"" suicide,  which stems from a deep engagement with the existential realization of life's meaninglessness.   The author debates whether the nihilistic suicide could be seen as more 'authentic' because it is not an escape but a deliberate choice that aligns  with a certain logical consistency when one has fully embraced the void. The worldly suicide, by contrast, might be",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"seen as an attempt to flee from a temporary disruption in an otherwise perceived 'good' life.  Part 4: The Possibility of a Nihilistic Language of Transcendence  The essay moves to consider whether a language or symbolism could be developed that acknowledges the experience of Nihilism while offering a form of transcendence. It questions whether such a language could  transform the despair of Nihilism into a spiritual journey, akin to the experiences of saints or mystics, without negating the nihilistic insights into  the absurdity of existence. ",[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"    The concept of an ""authentic"" suicide is further analyzed, in which the individual has moved beyond worldly attachments and sees no value in continued existence. This is contrasted with the person who commits suicide  due to a loss that disrupts their place in the world. The essay suggests that a person who has fully embraced Nihilism may see suicide as a logical and  even   ""authentic"" release into the divine or as a final affirmation of their worldview.  Part 5: The Logic of Suicide versus The Logic of Life   The essay then juxtaposes the logic of suicide with the logic of life, noting that those who subscribe to the logic of life find it inconceivable to  understand the reasoning behind a nihilistic suicide. The majority of people, according to the essay, are immersed in the ""logic of life,"" which involves a  commitment to find meaning in everyday existence and activities.   It's also mentioned that individuals who have encountered the ""Nothing"" of the world cannot fully convey",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"the profundity of their experience to those  who haven't questioned or recognized life's inherent meaninglessness.  Part 6: The Role of Thinking, Madness, and the Divine in Nihilism   The essay discusses the potential of embracing madness as an ideal, in the sense that it can lead to a profound religious or spiritual experience. It  suggests that the terror and the allure of madness might be akin to encountering the divine or the ""Other"" in Nihilism. The writer reflects on ",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   how challenging and demanding deep thought can be, and how madness may be a form of ultimate liberation or exploration.  Part 7: The Dichotomy of Public Perception and Personal Experience   Lastly, the essay acknowledges the dichotomy between how society views those who pursue a path of Nihilism and how these individuals perceive  themselves. Society oHen labels them as mad or depressed, while they might see themselves as having a more sincere or deeper grasp of reality.  The author points out the irony of society's acceptance of trivial pursuits while mocking or misunderstanding the search.  Part 8: The Uncomfortable Reality of Nihilism and the Potential for Transcendence   The writer contemplates why the embrace of Nihilism oHen makes others uncomfortable and why thinking deeply about existence can lead to  skepticism, despair, and the confrontation with Nihilism.

For some, the awareness can lead to an obsessive engagement with the  meaninglessness, rejecting all distractions. For others, this realization might be a cause for despair and a temptation towards suicide. The essay probes  whether there's a ""correct"" response to Nihilism, whether it's suicide, faith, or some form of transcendence.  Part 10: Distinguishing between Types of Suicide and Their Underlying Motivations   The text distinguishes between types of suicide, suggesting that some may result from a retreat from worldly failure and others from a deeper nihilistic  realization. The question is raised whether the motivation behind a suicide could affect its meaning or authenticity, and whether those who have not  lost all worldly attachments can be pulled back from the brink.

Part 12: Insights and Perspectives from Various Thinkers   The essay's extra notes and quotes section provides additional context and scholarly support for the main themes, providing a wealth of insights from  various philosophers, mystics, and writers who have addressed the themes of Nihilism, madness, and transcendence. These figures, ranging from  Vivekananda to Kierkegaard, offer diverse perspectives on the desire to transcend the mundane and embrace a more profound, oHen religious or  spiritual, understanding of existence.  Vivekananda, for example, speaks of the yearning to become 'Godintoxicated,' which reflects a passionate pursuit of divine madness over mundane rationality. These sentiments echo the earlier discussion in the essay on the potential of  Nihilism to lead not just to despair but also to a kind of ecstatic truth.

******************"   Part 14: The Role of Suffering and Solitude in Spiritual Awakening  The authors cited in the extra notes suggest that suffering and solitude can play significant roles in spiritual awakening. They propose that through  confronting the darkest aspects of life — such as death and meaninglessness — one can achieve a clearer vision of reality. This process can lead to a deep  sense of liberation from societal expectations and a closer engagement with existential truths.  Part 15: The Contrast Between Natural Life and Spiritual Death  The essay emphasizes the contrast between what is considered   'natural life' — the pursuit of happiness and avoidance of suffering — and 'spiritual death,' where one comes to terms with the ultimate  meaninglessness of such pursuits. There's a recognition that the understanding of true despair or the 'sickness unto death,' as Kierkegaard  calls it, is beyond the comprehension of the 'natural man.'

The philosophers and writers cited suggest that through this process, one may arrive at a state of being that is  fundamentally at odds with societal norms, which oHen value superficial distractions over deep contemplation.  Part 18: Societal Misunderstanding of the Nihilistic Journey  Society's discomfort with the nihilistic journey is further examined, as those who seek meaning beyond conventional understandings oHen face ridicule or are deemed unwell. The thinkers highlighted in the notes argue that the  societal impulse to 'cure' or 'correct' those who reject life's superficial pleasures is misguided and fails to recognize the legitimacy and potential  depth of their existential crisis.

This inner conflict is seen as an essential part of the human condition and a driving force behind the quest for understanding and  meaning.  Part 21: Conclusion and the Question of Suicide   The essay concludes with a contemplation on the question of suicide within the context of Nihilism. It challenges readers to consider whether suicide, in  response to the realization of life's absurdity, might be a rational act or whether it represents a failure to find a more profound response to the void.  The text leaves open the question of whether an alternative, more transcendental language of Nihilism could offer a meaningful path forward  for those who grapple with these existential dilemmas.

It challenges the conventional understandings of nihilism found in mainstream philosophy, aiming to offer a new interpretation that feels more authentic to the author's personal experience. The writer emphasizes a non-traditional approach by extensively quoting from various thinkers without feeling the need to defend this method. The quotes are intended to show different perspectives converging towards a single, unified insight into the experience of nihilism. The author expresses a desire for their own voice to be lost among these citations, implying that the message is more significant than the messenger.",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************

******************"   Nothingness -The Remembering of the Recollected Self- Part 1: Introduction to Nihilism and Its Implications  The document is a philosophical exploration of nihilism—the idea that life and existence are inherently meaningless. The writer grapples with the impacts of this perspective on human life and thought, questioning the point  of human endeavors, the legitimacy of suicide, and whether a philosophy or religion can be built on the foundation of nihilism. The text seeks to  establish whether nihilism possesses any constructive elements that could be interpreted as a form of religious experience or whether it is merely a  destructive force.  Part 2: Nihilism's Challenge to Philosophy and Religion  The writer criticizes modern philosophy, particularly within American universities, as being detached from existential concerns, reduced to intellectual exercises akin to puzzles. The existence of God, the problem of  evil, and the reliance on human reason are called into question. On the",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************

******************"   Part 3: The Existential Situation of Humans  The text delves into the idea that humans, by nature, engage in constant activity to avoid facing the void—the abyss of meaninglessness that  underlies our existence. This avoidance comes in many forms, from the mundane to the intellectual, and is seen as a distraction from confronting  nihilism directly. The writer posits that genuine engagement with nihilism is rare and that most philosophical and religious pursuits fail to address it  wholly and are thereby fundamentally misguided.  Part 4: The Experience of Nihilism   The writer emphasizes that to truly understand nihilism, one must directly experience its profound sense of nothingness. It is through this encounter  that the full weight of life's meaninglessness is felt—not as a subjective value judgment but as an objective realization.

Part 5: The Insignificance of Human Endeavors The draft continues to explore the absurdity of human activities when viewed against the backdrop of nihilism.

The text  wrestles with the question of why people continue to ascribe meaning to their lives despite the overwhelming evidence of life's transient nature. The writer ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   argues that most people are in denial of the pervasive nothingness that defines existence.  Part 6: The Possibility of Constructive Nihilism   The writer asks whether nihilism can have any constructive implications. Can the experience of nihilism, with its deep sense of boredom, anxiety, and  despair, offer any message or guidance? Is there something beyond the destruction and emptiness that nihilism brings? The text seeks to explore  these questions while maintaining a critical stance on the typical answers provided by both religious and secular philosophies.  Part 7: Nihilism's Relation to Transcendence and Religion  The draH discusses the concept of ""Transcendence"" as an alternative to ""religious"" experiences, suggesting that nihilism may not only be a deconstructive force but could also lead to a form of transcendence—a  wholly Other aspect of human experience. The writer cautions against conflating this transcendence with mystical or supernatural notions, instead focusing on",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************

Part 8: The Challenge of Living with Nihilism  In the final section, the writer questions how one can live once nihilism is fully acknowledged. It critiques the ways in which society, philosophy, and religion oHen attempt to sidestep the confrontation with nihilism. The writer  concludes that there is no escaping nihilism, that there is no ultimate ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   solution within the world, and that all human attempts to find or create meaning are ultimately doomed to failure in the face of the infinite.  Part 9: The Paradox of Subjective Meaning in an Objective   Nihilistic Universe  The writer contemplates the paradox of finding subjective meaning in a universe that is objectively meaningless according to nihilism. They examine the human tendency to attach significance to personal experiences, efforts,  and achievements, despite their eventual disappearance and lack of enduring impact in the vastness of cosmic time—the so-called 'deep time'.  This subjective sense of meaning is seen as a psychological or intellectual defense against the stark reality of existential nullity.  Part 10: The Absurdity of Inventing Meaning  The document illustrates the absurdity of inventing meaning through a metaphorical scenario where two people play a game of tennis without a ball. This scenario is used to highlight the futility of engaging in activities",[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"that lack inherent purpose or substance. The writer questions how long one  can maintain such an illusory sense of meaning before it ultimately becomes unsatisfying or unbearable.  Part 11: The Rarity of Nihilistic Experience and Its Consequences  The writer discusses the rarity of a true nihilistic experience, where the full weight of life's meaninglessness is felt, and the implications of such an experience. They suggest that the busyness of life, the distractions we ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   create, and the evasion of the uncanny nature of existence are ways in which we miss or ignore the message that nihilism may carry. The text ponders why the experience of nihilism is not more common and what it means for  those seeking authenticity and a deeper understanding of human existence.  Part 12: The Potential of a Philosophy or Language of   Nihilism  Finally, the draft proposes the challenge of developing a philosophy or language that stems from the direct experience of nihilism. The writer recognizes the need for a framework that acknowledges the destructive  aspects of nihilism but also explores its potential for constructive content, even if it might ultimately be illusory. The possibility of nihilism leading to  madness, suicide, or a transcendent Other is considered, leaving open the question of what lies beyond the experience of meaninglessness.  The document concludes with the notion that nihilism, as the ground for all transcendent thinking, demands an emphasis on",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************

******************"   The Symbolic Resonance of Nothing -The Dialectical Silence- Overview The draft is a philosophical exploration of Nihilism and its implications for language, existence, and the human condition. The writer investigates whether it's possible to develop a language that authentically engages with the concept of  Nihilism—a worldview that sees life and the universe as lacking inherent meaning or value. The document contemplates how such a language can  navigate the ""Nothing"" that Nihilism proposes while also allowing for the possibility of transcending this meaninglessness.  The author references various philosophers and thinkers, such as Martin Heidegger, to discuss the challenges of facing the abyss of human consciousness  and the ultimate reality—or lack thereof.   Central to the discussion are questions about the role of philosophical thinking vis-à-vis Nihilism, the potential for a Nihilistic language to express and confront  the ""Nothing,"" and the human mind's ability to grapple",[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"with a seemingly meaningless existence.  Part 1: The Dilemma of Language and Nihilism  The writer begins by addressing the inadequacy of language when it comes to discussing Nihilism. They argue that clichés and ""idle talk"" fail to capture ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   the depth and implications of a Nihilistic perspective, suggesting that traditional expressions are insufficient to convey the true experience of Nihilism, which is characterized by its non-transferable nature.  Part 2: The Human Condition and Nihilism  The draft delves into the human tendency to seek meaning and security in the face of a potentially meaningless existence. It questions whether humans can authentically confront Nihilism without succumbing to self- deception or escaping into comforting illusions. The author examines the possibility of ""Being-towards-death,"" as described by Heidegger, and  whether humans can embrace this existential standpoint.  Part 3: Heidegger's Influence and Language Development   Heidegger's concepts are presented as the foundation for developing a language of Nihilism, with terms such as ""anxiety,"" ""authenticity,"" and  ""Being-Towards-Death"" providing insights into the human condition that could pave the way for a Nihilistic language. However,",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"this raises the question of whether   Heidegger's analysis, oHen labeled ""atheistic,"" can be reconciled with religious perspectives, like those of Thomas Merton.  Part 4: The Search for a Nihilistic Language  The author proposes the term ""Nihiltheism"" as a way to ground the experience of Nihilism without falling into the traps of naturalistic or religious worldviews. This language is meant to be symbolic and self-critical, ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   always open for reinterpretation. The intention is not to provide comfort from the Nothingness but to confront it and allow for a genuine encounter with the terror of existence.  Part 5: The Challenge of Describing Nihilistic Experience  The writer acknowledges the difficulty in finding words that adequately capture the Nihilistic experience. They cite St. Therese of Lisieux's struggle to articulate her spiritual darkness within a Christian framework as an example  of the challenges inherent in conveying deeply personal and transformative experiences.  Part 6: The Role of Silence and Renunciation  The draft suggests that those who have truly encountered Nihilism may be left with no choice but to embrace a silent acknowledgment of their condition. However, it also points out that few are willing to completely  renounce the world, underscoring that experiencing Nothing and renouncing everything are not the same.  Part 7: Affirmative Aspects of Nihilism   The author explores whether",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"there is something affirmative within the experience of Nihilism that can be used to develop a language capable of  acknowledging and transcending worldly suffering. They reference the mystic Cioran’s idea of the   ""affirmative substance"" of Nothing, where even in the realization of life's futility, one can find a path towards a higher reality. ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   Part 8: The Need for a New Language  The need for a language that addresses Nihilism is tied to the human desire to confront rather than replace the Transcendental yearning that Nihilism  evokes. The writer quotes Aldous Huxley on the limitations of conventional theology and the necessity for a language that can be comprehended only  by those who have transcended ordinary, unregenerate experiences.  Part 9: Heidegger's Terms as a Foundation   Using Heidegger's framework, the draft outlines the basic structure of a potential language of Nihilism, focusing on the concept of ""Being-Towards- Death."" This concept involves experiencing anxiety in a profound moment that calls the individual to understand something incommunicable, leading  to a sense of insignificance in the world and a push towards authenticity.  Part 10: Heidegger vs. Religious Perspectives   The author compares Heidegger's notion of ""Being-TowardsDeath"" with the views of Trappist monk Thomas Merton, who also",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"acknowledges the emptiness of constant outward seeking. The comparison raises the question  of whether the language of Nihilism could bridge the gap between the atheistic overtones oHen ascribed to Heidegger's philosophy and the theistic  language used by Merton.  Part 11: Transcendence Through Nihilism   The writer examines the concept of the ""True-Self"" and how it might be understood in a way that transcends both naturalistic and religious ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   interpretations. They express skepticism about traditional religious approaches that offer answers rather than embracing the mystery of existence, which is seen as a form of idolatry.  Part 12: The Futile Optimism and Scientific Realism  The draft criticizes the 'optimistic' outlook prevalent in American culture and certain scientific circles, where empirical reality is regarded as the ultimate truth without questioning the underlying reasons for existence. The author  argues that this 'optimistic scientism' is a form of 'unthinking' that fails to acknowledge the deeper philosophical questions.     Part 13: The Rejection of Traditional Religious  Interpretations  The writer takes issue with traditional religious interpretations of the human condition, which oHen rely on unexamined theological assumptions, rituals, and dogmas. By contrast, the proposed language of Nihilism would  focus on the relentless inquiry into the nature of Being rather than providing pre-packaged answers ",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"Part 14: Conclusion and Further Exploration  In summary, the writer advocates for a language of Nihilism that would serve as a map through the Nothingness of the world without claiming to offer ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   'truth'. This language should be filled with doubt, continually asking ""Why?"" and preparing the individual for the possibility of transcendence. The draft concludes with an invitation to further explore the tensions between the  experience of Nihilism and the development of a language that can genuinely reflect it.  Part 15: Extra Notes and Quotes  An assortment of additional thoughts and quotes from Heidegger and other thinkers are provided, which the author plans to incorporate into a more polished piece. These notes reflect the ongoing struggle to articulate a  coherent response to Nihilism and suggest the shape that a future language might take.   The writer ends with a reflection on the non-transferability of the Nihilistic experience and the paradox of developing a language for something that  inherently resists articulation. This contradiction is acknowledged with a degree of irony, suggesting that the very act of trying to create a language for Nihilism may be inherently",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"flawed or futile.  Part 16: The Universality and Rarity of Nihilism  The draft touches on the universality of the Nihilistic experience, which, while being a fundamental aspect of being human, is rarely confronted directly due to its challenging and unsettling nature. The writer asks why this  experience is so infrequently and fully embraced, positing that the difficulty lies in the intensity and profundity of fully realizing Nihilism. ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"   Part 17: Final Thoughts on Nihilistic Language  In the concluding thoughts, the author grapples with the purpose and potential utility of a Nihilistic language. They ponder whether such a  language serves as a guide through the Nothingness of the world, facilitating a push towards transcendence, or whether it's merely replacing traditional  religious rituals with another form of structure. The language of Nihilism is envisioned as a tentative and doubting map, constantly questioning and  open to reinterpretation, rather than as a doctrine offering certainty and closure.  Part 18: Reflections on Quietism and Solitude  The draft ends with reflections on the relationship between the proposed language and concepts like quietism and solitude. Given that idle talk and distraction are seen as barriers to confronting Nihilism, the language of  Nihilism might necessitate solitude and silence as conditions for its development and understanding.  Your draft presents a deep and nuanced",[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************"examination of Nihilism and the possibility of a language that could engage with its existential challenges. It's a complex blend of philosophical inquiry, critical assessment of both religious and  atheistic interpretations of existence, and a search for an authentic means of expressing the inexpressible. The document suggests that while constructing such  a language may be paradoxical or even impossible, the pursuit itself is a meaningful endeavor that could lead to greater understanding and acceptance of  the human condition. ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: lexrensum]]******************
******************" Part 2: The Nature of the Individual's Experience  The author delves into a personal struggle between smug confidence and complete humility, expressing that the work is rooted in as real an experience as any other part of their existence. However, doubt remains a prominent feature in every aspect of the writing, highlighting the paradoxical nature of claiming any absolute truth while simultaneously seeking help and questioning everything. The document reveals the intention to vary tones and potentially give the impression of multiple authors being involved, which reflects the multifaceted nature of the subject matter and the author's own internal conflicts and diversity of thought. Part 3: Philosophical Quotes and Their Role  The author continues to weave in quotes from different philosophers and thinkers, using their ideas to underscore the complexity of the human condition and the struggle to find meaning. These quotes serve to illustrate the shared insights of various",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************
******************"philosophers, suggesting an underlying unity in their descriptions of existential experiences. The inclusion of these quotes is meant to demonstrate that regardless of the diverse backgrounds or labels of the thinkers—whether they are Christian, Hindu, Nihilist, or otherwise—their experiences and articulations of nihilism are fundamentally similar. Part 4: The Author's Stance on Knowledge and Scholarly Work  ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************
******************" The author criticizes traditional academia and the pursuit of 'scholarly' work, suggesting that the quest for knowledge or pride in one's intellectual accomplishments is misguided. They argue that true philosophy is an ongoing, never-completed process of questioning and exploration, akin to a ""story"" rather than a concluded argument. Part 5: Nihilism as Inescapable Truth  In this section, the author suggests that nihilism is the only 'truth' that can be universally experienced or 'known' by humans, as it does not offer answers but rather represents the lack of them. The experience of nihilism is depicted as something that cuts through the fabric of all human convictions, revealing the absence of ultimate knowledge or paths to follow. It is portrayed as unavoidable, inherent in every human life, whether acknowledged or not. Part 6: Philosophical Quotes on Nihilism and Existence  The draH continues to interlace philosophical quotes that touch on topics like the fear of nothingness, the",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************
******************"nature of anxiety, and the illusion of certainty and knowledge. These quotes further establish nihilism as an existential baseline—a default state that underlies all human experience and thought. The philosophers cited seem to grapple with the same issues, despite the varied lexicons and cultural contexts from which they emerge. Part 7: Critiques and Personal Reflections  The author anticipates criticisms of their work, acknowledging that ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************
******************" because the experience of nihilism is rare, any critiques are likely to miss the mark. They assert their intention to report experiences without censorship, even if that involves contradicting established views or themselves. The text implies that the author seeks no validation or approval for their thoughts, instead aligning themselves with the quoted thinkers as equals in their confrontation with nihilism. Part 8: Philosophical and Religious Vocations  A comparison is drawn between the calling of a poet and that of a priest, implying that true commitment to a calling—whether in art or religion—requires something more profound than mere certification or examination. The author seems to question the authenticity of those who claim authority without the profound personal experience to back it up. Part 9: Conclusion and Acknowledgment of Nihilism's Complexity   The author concludes by reiterating the complexity of nihilism and its resistance to simplification. They express skepticism",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************
******************"about the value of their own writing and the act of writing in general, as well as a desire to make others uncomfortable and to challenge them to confront the abyss of existence. The draH ends with the author positioning themselves as an observer of the absurdity of attempting to describe the indescribable. The additional notes and quotes at the end of the draH suggest further development of concepts discussed in the main text, such as ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************
******************" reflections on the nature of despair, the concept of immortality , and the universal aspects of nihilism. These notes seem to serve as a reservoir of ideas for expanding the main text. Part 10: Immortality and the ASerlife  The author challenges traditional notions of immortality and the aHerlife, arguing that seeking eternal life or heaven oHen reflects a naïve faith or a misunderstanding of the human condition. The document cites thinkers who express skepticism about the coherence of the world and the plausibility of an aHerlife that merely extends earthly experiences into infinity. Instead, the author implies that such immortality concepts fail to address the deeper existential problems that nihilism exposes. Part 11: Universal Experience of Nihilism  The author incorporates quotes that emphasize the universality of nihilism, suggesting that all people, knowingly or unknowingly, experience despair—a central theme in nihilist thought. This despair is not tied to any particular",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************

Part 12: The Illusion of Simple Salvation  In the final portion of the notes, the idea of simple salvation is explored.

The author returns to ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************
******************" Kierkegaard's thoughts, which highlight the inadequacy of superficial solutions and the depth required to truly engage with spiritual matters. Part 13: The Individual's Search for Meaning  The document culminates by encouraging an individual approach to religion and philosophy, one where personal insights remain private and sacred. The author stresses the importance of seeking one's own understanding rather than blindly following established doctrines. This pursuit of personal meaning is juxtaposed with the societal pressure to conform and the disillusionment that can arise when acknowledging the depth of existential despair. Conclusion Overall, the document presents a deep dive into nihilism, as both a philosophical concept and a personal experience. It is rich with quotes and reflections that span centuries and cultures, yet coalesce around the central theme of meaninglessness. The author's writing is both an exploration and a confession, a testament of the struggle between the",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************

******************" Summary The Abyssal Experience of Nihilism -Philosophy and Direct Experience- Part 1: Introduction to The Abyssal Experience of Nihilism Exploration of Nihilism: The document delves into nihilism, a philosophical concept that suggests life, values, and the universe inherently lack meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. It grapples with the implications of embracing a nihilistic viewpoint and how it affects our understanding of existence. Philosophy and Life's Significance: The text opens by questioning the significance of life and philosophical inquiry. It references Cicero's belief that philosophy prepares one for death and Heidegger's thoughts on being struck by the strangeness of existence, which leads to the fundamental ""Why?"" of life. Human Activity and Meaninglessness: The idea that human actions are ultimately meaningless is presented. The text suggests that much of what drives human behavior—our goals and distractions—are rooted in an ignorance of nihilism. The breakdown of",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************

Part 2: Philosophy's Role and Limitations Critique of Academic Philosophy: The draH criticizes contemporary academic philosophy, particularly the American university approach, as having become a sterile intellectual exercise akin to solving a puzzle, disconnected from existential concerns. It argues that philosophy has lost touch with the profound questions of existence due to an overemphasis on analytic reasoning. The Scholar's Dilemma: There is a portrayal of scholars as people who can't think independently but merely react to pre-existing thoughts, echoing Nietzsche's criticism of academia. The text suggests that scholars lack original thought and are trapped by their dependence on the ideas of others. Atheism and the Problem of Evil: The document challenges atheist philosophers on the grounds that their rejection of God and reliance on human reason lack a non-pragmatic basis in a naturalistic worldview, questioning why reason",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************

Part 3: Existential Conditions and Philosophy's Potential Existential Disillusionment: The text discusses how, when the veneer of life's immediate concerns is stripped away, individuals may confront a profound sense of disillusionment and the meaninglessness of their achievements in the face of death and the vastness of time. Philosophy's Limitations and Death: The draH continues to argue that philosophy, in its traditional form, cannot fully address the human confrontation with death. It suggests that most philosophies dodge the issue of mortality and fail to acknowledge the transformative impact of facing one's finitude. Philosophy as Interpretation: The author posits that philosophy should not be seen as a provider of definitive truths but rather as a method to interpret and explain existence. This interpretation leads to the conclusion that philosophy should aim to create a 'map of consequences' derived from the",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************

******************" Part 4: Addressing the Experience of Nihilism Constructive Content of Nihilism: The draH explores whether within the desolate landscape of nihilism, there might be a kernel of constructive content—a 'message' or a transformative insight— despite its fundamentally destructive nature. It ponders the possibility of interpreting this experience in a way that isn't purely negative. The Role of Philosophy in Nihilism: The author suggests that philosophy should not be engaged in the business of formulating arguments or systems of knowledge, but rather in understanding and articulating the 'reality' of experiences like boredom, anxiety, despair, and ecstasy that are associated with nihilism. Heidegger's Analysis of Human Condition: Philosopher Martin Heidegger's work is invoked to dissect the human condition, emphasizing the importance of not predefining experiences with atheistic or theistic language to avoid confusion and to capture the essence of the experience of nothingness. Re-defining",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************
******************'Religious' Experience: The text calls for a redefinition or avoidance of the term 'religious' due to its various connotations and instead suggests using 'Transcendence' to describe experiences that reach beyond mundane existence. Part 5: Nihilism and Transcendence,[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************
******************" Transcendence and Nihilism: The text posits that experiences of nihilism, with their deconstructive qualities, may actually lay the groundwork for transcendence—a state of being that goes beyond the physical or material aspects of life. This state is not necessarily religious in the traditional sense but is an acknowledgment of something that is ""Wholly-Other."" Naturalism vs. Transcendental Interpretations: The author contrasts naturalistic interpretations, which ground human experience and understanding in materialism and science, with transcendental ones that suggest there may be more to human existence than what's observable or measurable. The Ground of Transcendent Thinking: Various depths of nihilism are explored as a possible common foundation for all forms of transcendental thinking, suggesting that these experiences are universal, though oHen avoided or misinterpreted. The Finite and the Infinite: The text grapples with the relationship between the finite nature of human",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************
******************"experience and the concept of the Infinite. It suggests that human attempts to move beyond the experience of nihilism oHen result in confusion or misunderstandings, rooted in the limitations of human understanding. Rarity of Nihilism's Experience: The text reflects on how the everyday distractions and engagements of life oHen prevent people from confronting the full weight of nihilism. It posits that even though nihilism is a universal undercurrent, the direct and transformative ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************
******************" experience of it is rare. Part 6: Implications and Paths Forward The Rarity of Nihilistic Experiences: The text suggests that the reason full encounters with nihilism are rare is due to an instinctual or conscious inclination to engage with the world. This engagement masks the underlying nothingness, allowing individuals to feel they are living meaningful lives despite the potential absence of intrinsic meaning. Madness, Suicide, and the Other: The author then touches on the potential outcomes of facing nihilism: madness, suicide, or a turn towards the Other (which could represent a form of transcendence or ultimate reality). The relationship between these responses is considered, questioning whether they are mutually exclusive or intrinsically linked. Philosophy's Limitations and Contributions: Philosophy is seen as having the potential to contribute to understanding nihilism if it can move beyond traditional frameworks and engage directly with human experiences of nothingness. The",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************
******************document argues for a philosophy rooted in the lived experience rather than abstract theorization. The Struggle with Nothingness: The draH considers the struggle with nothingness as a defining aspect of human existence. It weighs the possibility that this struggle may contain a hidden message or revelation that could reshape one's understanding of life.,[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************
******************" The Inevitability of Nihilism: Finally, the document contends that there is no ultimate escape from nihilism; it is an ever-present reality beneath the surface of existence. It challenges readers to consider how one might authentically engage with this reality and potentially find a path through it that does not lead to despair. --- Summary: The Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism -Awaken, Material Nightmare- Part 1: Introduction and the Philosophical Dilemma Your document begins with an exploration of the struggle between traditional religious belief and a modern understanding that might exclude the presence of a divine entity or ultimate reality. The opening quotes from Spong, Sartre, and Vivekananda set the stage for a discussion on the challenges that contemporary individuals face when reconciling their spiritual beliefs with a scientific and practical worldview.

******************" Part 2: The Nature of Despair and Religious Perspectives what's described as a Nihilistic experience—a profound sense of the meaningless or absurdity of life—but instead of confronting it, they turn away and distract themselves with various activities. This turning away is likened to an ""always falling"" condition, tied to Western and Christian cultural constructs such as 'original sin' or scientific reductions of consciousness to mere accidents. This results in a ""divided-self"" where one is torn between engaging with the finite, material world and the pursuit of something infinite or transcendent. This divided-self is depicted as inescapable and pervasive, influencing how people react to the world and their place within it. Through various philosophical and religious quotes, the draH illustrates the inner conflict that arises from this condition.

Several religious perspectives are brought into the conversation, suggesting that genuine religiosity involves a profound dissatisfaction with the world and a renunciation of its superficialities. This renunciation is not an intellectual exercise but a lived experience of turning away from the world—a common thread in many mystical traditions, like those of Christianity, Buddhism, and Taoism. The discussion highlights the struggle between the worldly and the spiritual. The draH delves into the tension between naturalism—the focus on the material and finite world—and the pull toward something beyond this, a Transcendent aspect of reality.

Part 5: Nihilism, Indifference, and Participation rather than being authentically ourselves. Guilt, in this sense, is not about social or moral failings but about the failure to recognize and actualize our deepest potentialities.

As the draH continues, it contrasts the overwhelming draw of worldly meaning with the potential for a Transcendental perspective. The seductive nature of assigning importance to everyday life and its activities is depicted as a cancerous illusion, one that obstructs a clear view of the inherent lack of meaning in the world. This section scrutinizes the human tendency to find solace in personal relationships, achievements, and societal progress, suggesting that these are merely distractions from the harsh reality of existence.

Nihilism is seen as a destructive force that cannot be easily reconciled with a return to normal life once it has been fully realized; the world becomes transparent and dead to those who experience it. The text concludes with a reflection on the function of Nihilism in pushing individuals beyond superficial engagements with the world. It challenges the reader to consider why anyone would want to participate in Nihilism, suggesting that it is not an end in itself but a means to confront and perhaps transcend the limitations of existence.

Throughout, the draH emphasizes the need for a philosophical approach that remains open to the questions and mysteries inherent in being human. By comparing the casual acceptance of existence to the profound sense of ""cosmic panic"" that some argue is central to the human experience, the draH indicates that a  truly philosophical outlook must grapple with the absurdity and uncanniness of life.

The draH questions whether this proposed courage is a genuine confrontation with Nihilism or a means of retreating from it. The text suggests that true courage might lie not in facing the world but in acknowledging the futility of doing so. The draH concludes by suggesting that the existential challenge is not to find meaning or happiness within the world but to confront the reality of its absence. It offers a somber perspective that sees  the human condition as one of inevitable disillusionment with the world and a constant struggle to make sense of a life that is ultimately without inherent purpose or value.

******************" Other -The Suicide of the Renouncer- Part 1: Introduction to Nihilism Part 2: Madness, Suicide, and Their Relation to Nihilism The essay begins by examining the concept of Nihilism and its impact on human consciousness and behavior. Nihilism is essentially the belief in the absence of inherent meaning in life. The author quotes a variety of thinkers who have touched upon existential themes, from the despair and madness that can arise from a deep understanding of human existence to the potential healing that such an understanding might also bring. The central question posed is whether the full acknowledgement of Nihilism necessarily leads to madness or suicide, or if it can be a path to a different kind of transcendence. The author suggests that while Nihilism can be distinguished from mental illness, it can still lead to profound psychological distress. This distress manifests as a confrontation with the void, or the nothingness, that underlies the façade of everyday life. The essay",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************

******************" Part 3: The Search for Authenticity in Nihilism with the despair of Nihilism, and whether or not madness is a state to be embraced as a form of deeper insight or rejected as a destructive end. A specific case is mentioned – that of Mitchell Heisman, a man who committed suicide aHer writing a 2,000-page manifesto on Nihilism. His act is used to illustrate the potential extremes of a nihilistic perspective, raising the question of whether there can be a rational justification for suicide in a world perceived as inherently irrational. The essay then confronts the topic of authenticity, particularly in the context of suicide. It differentiates between what might be considered ""worldly"" suicide, driven by loss or failure in life's pursuits, and ""nihilistic"" suicide, which stems from a deep engagement with the existential realization of life's meaninglessness. The author debates whether the nihilistic suicide could be seen as more 'authentic' because it is not an escape but a deliberate",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************

******************" Part 4: The Possibility of a Nihilistic Language of Transcendence Part 5: The Logic of Suicide versus The Logic of Life The essay moves to consider whether a language or symbolism could be developed that acknowledges the experience of Nihilism while offering a form of transcendence. It questions whether such a language could transform the despair of Nihilism into a spiritual journey, akin to the experiences of saints or mystics, without negating the nihilistic insights into the absurdity of existence. The concept of an ""authentic"" suicide is further analyzed, in which the individual has moved beyond worldly attachments and sees no value in continued existence. This is contrasted with the person who commits suicide due to a loss that disrupts their place in the world. The essay suggests that a person who has fully embraced Nihilism may see suicide as a logical and even ""authentic"" release into the divine or as a final affirmation of their worldview. The essay then juxtaposes the logic",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: ren_sum_sections]]******************

The essay discusses the potential of embracing madness as an ideal, in the sense that it can lead to a profound religious or spiritual experience. It suggests that the terror and the allure of madness might be akin to encountering the divine or the ""Other"" in Nihilism. The writer reflects on how challenging and demanding deep thought can be, and how madness may be a form of ultimate liberation or exploration.

The question is raised whether the motivation behind a suicide could affect its meaning or authenticity, and whether those who have not lost all worldly attachments can be pulled back from the brink. The essay concludes by questioning whether the development of a language that encapsulates both the naturalistic and transcendental aspects of Nihilism is worthwhile. It ponders the value of suicide in the face of Nihilism and whether it represents a rational and authentic response to the understanding that life is intrinsically void of meaning.

The writer grapples with the impacts of this perspective on human life and thought, questioning the point of human endeavors, the legitimacy of suicide, and whether a philosophy or religion can be built on the foundation of nihilism. The text seeks to establish whether nihilism possesses any constructive elements that could be interpreted as a form of religious experience or whether it is merely a destructive force.

The text delves into the idea that humans, by nature, engage in constant activity to avoid facing the void—the abyss of meaninglessness that underlies our existence. This avoidance comes in many forms, from the mundane to the intellectual, and is seen as a distraction from confronting nihilism directly.

They argue that clichés and ""idle talk"" fail to capture the depth and implications of a Nihilistic perspective, suggesting that traditional expressions are insufficient to convey the true experience of Nihilism, which is characterized by its non-transferable nature.

The author proposes the term ""Nihiltheism"" as a way to ground the experience of Nihilism without falling into the traps of naturalistic or religious worldviews. This language is meant to be symbolic and self-critical, always open for reinterpretation. The intention is not to provide comfort from the Nothingness but to confront it and allow for a genuine encounter with the terror of existence.

They reference the mystic Cioran’s idea of the ""affirmative substance"" of Nothing, where even in the realization of life's futility, one can find a path towards a higher reality. The need for a language that addresses Nihilism is tied to the human desire to confront rather than replace the Transcendental yearning that Nihilism evokes.

In exactly the same sense, God is neither unknowable nor known, but infinitely higher than both;  for He is our real Self.   First, we see then that the question, ""What caused the Absolute?"" is a contradiction in terms; and secondly, we find that the idea of God in the Advaita is this Oneness; and, therefore,  we cannot objectify Him, for we are always living and moving in Him, whether we know it or not. Whatever we do is always through Him. Now the question is: What are time, space, and causation? Advaita means non-duality; there are no two, but one.

It seems apparently very convincing that there are two. To  this the Advaitist replies that it cannot be called two. To have two, we must have two absolute independent existences which cannot be caused. In the first place time, space, and causation  cannot be said to be independent existences. Time is entirely a dependent existence; it changes with every change of our mind. Sometimes in dream one imagines that one has lived several years, at other times several months were passed as one second. So, time is entirely  dependent on our state of mind. Secondly, the idea of time vanishes altogether, sometimes. So with space. We cannot know what space is. Yet it is there, indefinable, and cannot exist  separate from anything else. So with causation.

So with time; you cannot have any idea of abstract time, but you have to take two events, one preceding and the other succeeding, and join the two events by the idea of succession. Time depends on two events, just as space has to be related to outside objects. And the idea of causation is inseparable from time and space. This is the peculiar thing about  them that they have no independent existence. They have not even the existence which the chair or the wall has. They are as shadows around everything which you cannot catch. They have no real existence; yet they are not non-existent, seeing that through them all things  are manifesting as this universe.

This is Maya.   The whole of this universe, therefore, is, as it were, a peculiar form; the Absolute is that ocean  while you and I, and suns and stars, and everything else are various waves of that ocean. And what makes the waves different? Only the form, and that form is time, space, and causation, all entirely dependent on the wave. As soon as the wave goes, they vanish. As soon as the individual gives up this Maya, it vanishes for him and he becomes free. The whole struggle is to get rid of this clinging on to time, space, and causation, which are always obstacles in our  way. What is the theory of evolution? What are the two factors?

This idea expressed in metaphysics will take this form; there are two components in every action, the one the subject, the other the object  and the one aim of life is to make the subject master of the object. For instance, I feel unhappy because a man scolds me. My struggle will be to make myself strong enough to conquer the environment, so that he may scold and I shall not feel.

So, there must come a time when we shall have conquered all environments. And how are we to conquer them? We cannot possibly conquer all the objective environments. We cannot. The little fish  wants to fly from its enemies in the water. How does it do so? By evolving wings and becoming a bird. The fish did not change the water or the air; the change was in itself.

This is, therefore, the process by which to achieve that conquest — through the subjective, by perfecting the subjective.

I am a materialist in a certain sense, because I believe that there is only One. That is what the materialist wants you to believe; only he calls it matter and I call it God. The materialists admit that out of this matter all hope, and religion, and everything have come. I say, all these have come out of Brahman. But the materialism that prevailed before Buddha was that crude sort of materialism which taught, ""Eat, drink, and be merry; there is no God, soul or  heaven; religion is a concoction of wicked priests.""

The mobs, the masses, and various races, had been converted to Buddhism; naturally the teachings of the Buddha became in time degenerated, because most of the people  were very ignorant. Buddhism taught no God, no Ruler of the universe, so gradually the masses brought their gods, and devils, and hobgoblins out again, and a tremendous hotchpotch was  made of Buddhism in India.

The salvation of Europe depends on a rationalistic religion, and Advaita — the non-duality, the Oneness, the idea of the Impersonal God — is the only religion that can have any hold on any intellectual people. It comes whenever religion seems  to disappear and irreligion seems to prevail, and that is why it has taken ground in Europe and America.

We want today that bright sun of intellectuality joined with the heart of Buddha, the wonderful infinite heart of love and mercy. This union will give us the highest philosophy. Science and religion will  meet and shake hands. Poetry and philosophy will become friends. This will be the religion of the future, and if we can work it out, we may be sure that it will be for all times and peoples.

Why  should men be moral? Because through morality is the path towards freedom, and immorality leads to bondage.  Another peculiarity of the Advaita system is that from its very start it is non-destructive. This is another glory, the boldness to preach, ""Do not disturb the faith of any, even of those who  through ignorance have attached themselves to lower forms of worship.""

So, from the very first, Advaita had no antagonism with the various sects existing in India. There are dualists existing today,  and their number is by far the largest in India, because dualism naturally appeals to less educated minds. It is a very convenient, natural, common-sense explanation of the universe. But with these dualists, Advaita has no quarrel.

We have been struggling to remedy this since the beginning of time, yet everything remains very much the same. The more we discover remedies, the more we find ourselves beset by subtler evils. We have also seen that all religions propose a God, as the one way of escaping these difficulties.  All religions tell us that if you take the world as it is, as most practical people would advise us to do in this age, then nothing would be left to us but evil. They further assert that there is something beyond this world. This life in the five senses, life in the material world, is not all; it  is only a small portion, and merely superficial.

A mosquito settled on the head of a man, and a friend, wishing to kill the mosquito, gave it such a blow that he killed both man and mosquito. The remedy of evil  seems to suggest a similar course of action. Life is full of ills, the world is full of evils; that is a fact no one who is old enough to know the world can deny.   But what is remedy proposed by all the religions? That this world is nothing. Beyond this world is something which is very real. Here comes the difficulty. The remedy seems to destroy everything.

At the same time we know that he who is carried along by his heart alone has to undergo many ills, for now and then he is liable to tumble into pitfalls.

Everything is forgotten; instead of encountering God I see the devil. Ever since we were born we have been told to see  God in all. Every religion teaches that — see God in everything and everywhere.

******************" CHAPTER VIII REALISATION (Delivered in London, 29th October 1896)   I will read to you from one of the Upanishads. It is called the Katha Upanishad. Some of you, perhaps, have read the translation by Sir Edwin Arnold, called the Secret of Death. In our last [i.e. a previous] lecture we saw how the inquiry which started with the origin of the world, and the creation of the universe, failed to obtain a satisfactory answer from without, and how it then turned inwards. This book psychologically takes up that suggestion, questioning into the internal  nature of man. It was first asked who created the external world, and how it came into being. Now the question is: What is that in man; which makes him live and move, and what becomes of that when he dies? The first philosophers studied the material substance, and tried to reach  the ultimate through that. At the best, they found a personal governor of the universe, a human  being immensely magnified, but yet to all intents and purposes a",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[i.e. a previous]] [[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************
******************"human being. But that could not be the whole of truth; at best, it could be only partial truth. We see this universe as human  beings, and our God is our human explanation of the universe.  Suppose a cow were philosophical and had religion it would have a cow universe, and a cow  solution of the problem, and it would not be possible that it should see our God. Suppose cats became philosophers, they would see a cat universe and have a cat solution of the problem of  the universe, and a cat ruling it. So we see from this that our explanation of the universe is not the whole of the solution. Neither does our conception cover the whole of the universe. It would  be a great mistake to accept that tremendously selfish position which man is apt to take. Such a  solution of the universal problem as we can get from the outside labours under this difficulty that in the first place the universe we see is our own particular universe, our own view of the Reality. That Reality we cannot see through",[[nihilism]] [[god]] [[nihilistic]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************
******************"the senses; we cannot comprehend It. We only know the  universe from the point of view of beings with five senses. Suppose we obtain another sense, the whole universe must change for us. Suppose we had a magnetic sense, it is quite possible  that we might then find millions and millions of forces in existence which we do not now know, and for which we have no present sense or feeling. Our senses are limited, very limited indeed; and within these limitations exists what we call our universe; and our God is the solution of  that universe, but that cannot be the solution of the whole problem. But man cannot stop there. He is a thinking being and wants to find a solution which will comprehensively explain all the universes. He wants to see a world which is at once the world of men, and of gods, and of all possible beings, and to find a solution which will explain all phenomena.   We see, we must first find the universe which includes all universes; we must find something which, by itself,",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************

If we could possibly find something which we could know as the common property of the lower as well as of the higher worlds, then our  problem would be solved. Even if by the sheer force of logic alone we could understand that there must be one basis of all existence, then our problem might approach to some sort of solution; but this solution certainly cannot be obtained only through the world we see and know,  because it is only a partial view of the whole.

******************" Our only hope then lies in penetrating deeper. The early thinkers discovered that the farther they were from; the centre, the more marked were the variations and differentiations; and that  the nearer they approached the centre, the nearer they were to unity. The nearer we are to the centre of a circle, the nearer we are to the common ground in which all the radii meet; and  the farther we are from the centre, the more divergent is our radial line from the others. The external world is far away from the centre, and so there is no common ground in it where all the phenomena of existence can meet. At best, the external world is but one part of the whole of phenomena. There are other parts, the mental, the moral, and the intellectual — the various  planes of existence — and to take up only one, and find a solution of the whole out of that one, is simply impossible. We first, therefore, want to find somewhere a centre from which, as it were, all the other planes of existence start, and",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************
******************"standing there we should try to find a solution. That is the proposition. And where is that centre? It is within us. The ancient sages penetrated deeper and deeper until they found that in the innermost core of the human soul is the centre of the whole universe. All the planes gravitate towards that one point. That is the common ground,  and standing there alone can we find a common solution. So the question who made this world is not very philosophical, nor does its solution amount to anything.   This the Katha Upanishad speaks in very figurative language. There was, in ancient times, a very rich man, who made a certain sacrifice which required that he should give away everything  that he had. Now, this man was not sincere. He wanted to get the fame and glory of having made the sacrifice, but he was only giving things which were of no further use to him — old cows, barren, blind, and lame. He had a boy called Nachiketas. This boy saw that his father was not doing what was right, that",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************
******************"he was breaking his vow; but he did not know what to say  to him. In India, father and mother are living gods to their children. And so the boy approached the father with the greatest respect and humbly inquired of him, ""Father, to whom are you going  to give me? For your sacrifice requires that everything shall be given away."" The father was very much vexed at this question and replied, ""What do you mean, boy? A father giving away  his own son?"" The boy asked the question a second and a third time, and then the angry father answered, ""Thee I give unto Death (Yama)."" And the story goes on to say that the boy went to Yama, the god of death. Yama was the first man who died. He went to heaven and became the  governor of all the Pitris; all the good people who die, go, and live with him for a long time. He is a very pure and holy person, chaste and good, as his name (Yama) implies.   So the boy went to Yama's world. But even gods are sometimes not at home, and three days this boy had to",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************
******************"wait there. After the third day Yama returned. ""O learned one,"" said Yama, ""you  have been waiting here for three days without food, and you are a guest worthy of respect. Salutation to thee, O Brahmin, and welfare to me! I am very sorry I was not at home. But for  that I will make amends. Ask three boons, one for each day."" And the boy asked, ""My first boon is that my father's anger against me may pass away; that he will be kind to me and recognise me when you allow me to depart."" Yama granted this fully. The next boon was that he wanted to know about a certain sacrifice which took people to heaven. Now we have seen that the  oldest idea which we got in the Samhitâ portion of the Vedas was only about heaven where they had bright bodies and lived with the fathers. Gradually other ideas came, but they were  not satisfying; there was still need for something higher. Living in heaven would not be very different from life in this world. At best, it would only be a very healthy rich man's",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************
******************"life, with plenty of sense-enjoyments and a sound body which knows no disease. It would be this material world, only a little more refined; and we have seen the difficulty that the external material world can never solve the problem. So no heaven can solve the problem. If this world cannot solve the  problem, no multiplication of this world can do so, because we must always remember that matter is only an infinitesimal part of the phenomena of nature. The vast part of phenomena which we actually see is not matter. For instance, in every moment of our life what a great part ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************

The sense-phenomena are very small compared with it. The heaven solution commits this mistake; it insists that the whole of phenomena is only in touch, taste, sight, etc. So this idea of heaven did not give full satisfaction to all. Yet  Nachiketas asks, as the second boon, about some sacrifice through which people might attain  to this heaven. There was an idea in the Vedas that these sacrifices pleased the gods and took human beings to heaven.  In studying all religions you will notice the fact that whatever is old becomes holy. For instance, our forefathers in India used to write on birch bark, but in time they learnt how to make paper.  Yet the birch bark is still looked upon as very holy. When the utensils in which they used to cook in ancient times were improved upon, the old ones became holy; and nowhere is this idea more kept up than in",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************
******************"India. Old methods, which must be nine or ten thousand years old, as of rubbing two sticks together to make fire, are still followed. At the time of sacrifice no other  method will do. So with the other branch of the Asiatic Aryans. Their modern descendants still  like to obtain fire from lightning, showing that they used to get fire in this way. Even when they learnt other customs, they kept up the old ones, which then became holy. So with the Hebrews.  They used to write on parchment. They now write on paper, but parchment is very holy. So with all nations. Every rite which you now consider holy was simply an old custom, and the Vedic  sacrifice were of this nature. In course of time, as they found better methods of life, their ideas were much improved; still these old forms remained, and from time to time they were practiced and received a holy significance.   Then, a body of men made it their business to carry on these sacrifices. These were the priests, who speculated on the",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************

The gods  came to enjoy the fragrance of the sacrifices, and it was considered that everything in this world could be got by the power of sacrifices. If certain oblations were made, certain hymns chanted,  certain peculiar forms of altars made, the gods would grant everything. So Nachiketas asks by what form of sacrifice can a man go to heaven. The second boon was also readily granted by Yama who promised that this sacrifice should henceforth be named after Nachiketas.  Then the third boon comes, and with that the Upanishad proper begins. The boy said, ""There is  this difficulty: when a man dies some say he is, others that he is not. Instructed by you I desire to understand this."" But Yama was frightened. He had been very glad to grant the other two boons. Now he said, ""The gods in ancient times were puzzled on this point. This subtle law is  not easy to understand.

But I cannot obtain another exponent like you and there is no other boon equal to this.""   Death said, ""Ask for sons and grandsons who will live one hundred years, many cattle, elephants, gold, and horses. Ask for empire on this earth and live as many ears as you like. Or choose any other boon which you think equal to these — wealth and long life. Or be thou a king,  O Nachiketas, on the wide earth. I will make thee the enjoyer of all desires. Ask for all those desires which are difficult to obtain in the world. These heavenly maidens with chariots and music, which are not to be obtained by man, are yours. Let them serve you.

Yama was pleased with this answer and said, ""Perfection is one thing and enjoyment another; these two having different ends, engage men differently. He who chooses perfection becomes pure. He who chooses enjoyment misses his true end. Both perfection and enjoyment present themselves to man; the wise man having examined both distinguishes one from the other. He chooses perfection as being superior to enjoyment, but the foolish man chooses enjoyment  for the pleasure of his body.

So long as these vain desires of our senses are clamouring and as it were dragging us outwards every moment,  making us slaves to everything outside — to a little colour, a little taste, a little touch — notwithstanding all our pretensions, how can the truth express itself in our hearts?

What it really means is what we read now. The mind is not to be ruffled by vain arguments, because argument will not help us to know God. It is a question of fact, and not of  argument. All argument and reasoning must be based upon certain perceptions. Without these, there cannot be any argument. Reasoning is the method of comparison between certain facts  which we have already perceived. If these perceived facts are not there already, there cannot be any reasoning. If this is true of external phenomena, why should it not be so of the internal? The chemist takes certain chemicals and certain results are produced.

We have to understand it and to realise what is understood. That  is religion. No amount of talk will make religion. So the question whether there is a God or not can never be proved by argument, for the arguments are as much on one side as on the other. But if there is a God, He is in our own hearts.

******************" CHAPTER IX UNITY IN DIVERSITY ( Delivered in London, 3rd November 1896 )   ""The Self-existent One projected the senses outwards and, therefore, a man looks outward, not within himself. A certain wise one, desiring immortality, with inverted senses, perceived the Self within."" As I have already said, the first inquiry that we find in the Vedas was concerning outward things, and then a new idea came that the reality of things is not to be found in the external world; not by looking outwards, but by turning the eyes, as it is literally expressed,  inwards. And the word used for the Soul is very significant: it is He who has gone inward, the innermost reality of our being, the heart centre, the core, from which, as it were, everything comes out; the central sun of which the mind, the body, the sense-organs, and everything else  we have are but rays going outwards.

******************"death, but the wise, understanding immortality, never seek for the Eternal in this life of finite things."" The same idea is here made  clear that in this external world, which is full of finite things, it is impossible to see and find the Infinite. The Infinite must be sought in that alone which is infinite, and the only thing infinite about us is that which is within us, our own soul. Neither the body, nor the mind, not even our  thoughts, nor the world we see around us, are infinite. The Seer, He to whom they all belong, the Soul of man, He who is awake in the internal man, alone is infinite, and to seek for the  Infinite Cause of this whole universe we must go there. In the Infinite Soul alone we can find it. ""What is here is there too, and what is there is here also. He who sees the manifold goes  from death to death.""

But as soon as philosophy came, men  found that this was impossible and absurd. The very idea of an infinite in place would be a contradiction in terms, as a place must begin and continue in time. Therefore they had to give up that idea. They found out that the gods who lived in these heavens had once been human  beings on earth, who through their good works had become gods, and the godhoods, as they call them, were different states, different positions; none of the gods spoken of in the Vedas are permanent individuals.

On the very face of it, you see the absurdity, for if it be carried out, every law of nature must have two parts, one of which is manipulated by one  god, and then he goes away and the other god manipulates the other part. There the difficulty comes that both are working in the same world, and these two gods keep themselves in harmony by injuring one portion and doing good to another. This is a crude case, of course, the  crudest way of expressing the duality of existence. But, take the more advanced, the more abstract theory that this world is partly good and partly bad.

We find, then, that this world is neither optimistic nor pessimistic; it is a mixture of both, and as we go on we shall find that the whole blame is taken away from nature and put upon our own  shoulders. At the same time the Vedanta shows the way out, but not by denial of evil, because it analyses boldly the fact as it is and does not seek to conceal anything. It is not hopeless; it is not agnostic. It finds out a remedy, but it wants to place that remedy on adamantine foundations: not by shutting the child's mouth and blinding its eyes with something which is  untrue, and which the child will find out in a few days. I remember when I was young, a young man's father died and left him poorly off, with a large family to support, and he found that his  father's friends were unwilling to help him.

The clergyman prayed, ""Thank God for  His mercies."" And the young man stood up and said, ""Stop, this is all misery."" The clergyman asked, ""Why?""

It says, ""Give  up what is evil and give up what is good."" What remains then?

******************" CHAPTER X THE FREEDOM OF THE SOUL (Delivered in London, 5th November 1896)   The Katha Upanishad, which we have been studying, was written much later than that to which we  now  turn  —  the  Chhândogya.  The  language  is  more  modern,  and  the  thought  more organised. In the older Upanishads the language is very archaic, like that of the hymn portion of the Vedas, and one has to wade sometimes through quite a mass of unnecessary things to get at the essential doctrines. The ritualistic literature about which I told you which forms the second  division of the Vedas, has left a good deal of its mark upon this old Upanishad, so that more than  half  of  it  is  still  ritualistic.  There  is,  however,  one  great  gain  in  studying  the  very  old Upanishads. You trace, as it were, the historical growth of spiritual ideas. In the more recent  Upanishads,  the  spiritual  ideas  have  been  collected  and  brought  into  one  place;  as  in  the  Bhagavad Gitâ, for instance, which",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************

But in the Gita you cannot study the rise of the spiritual ideas, you cannot trace them to their source. To do that, as has been pointed out by many, you must study the Vedas. The great idea of holiness that has been  attached to these books has preserved them, more than any other book in the world, from mutilation. In them, thoughts at their highest and at their lowest have all been preserved, the  essential and the non-essential, the most ennobling teachings and the simplest matters of detail stand side by side; for nobody has dared to touch them.

So we have this great advantage, we are able to  study thoughts in their original significance, to note how they developed, how from materialistic ideas finer and finer spiritual ideas are evolved, until they attained their greatest height in the Vedanta. Descriptions of some of the old manners and customs are also there, but they do not  appear much in the Upanishads. The language used is peculiar, terse, mnemonic.

Thus a great  difficulty arises, we scarcely know the real meaning of any one of these stories, because the traditions  have  nearly  died  out,  and  the  little  that  is  left  of  them  has  been  very  much exaggerated. Many new interpretations have been put upon them, so that when you find them in the  Purânas  they  have  already  become  lyrical  poems.  Just  as  in  the  West,  we  find  this  prominent fact in the political development of Western races that they cannot bear absolute rule, that they are always trying to prevent any one man from ruling over them, and are gradually advancing to higher and higher democratic ideas, higher and higher ideas of physical liberty, so,  in Indian metaphysics, exactly the same phenomenon appears in the development of spiritual life.

Not only was the idea of many governors of the universe ruling their destinies unbearable, but it was also intolerable that there should be one person ruling this universe. This is the first thing that strikes us. The idea grows and grows, until it attains its climax. In almost all of the Upanishads, we find the climax coming at the last, and  that  is  the  dethroning  of  this  God  of  the  universe.  The  personality  of  God  vanishes,  the  impersonality comes. God is no more a person, no more a human being, however magnified and exaggerated, who rules this universe, but He has become an embodied principle in every being, immanent in the whole universe. It would be illogical to go from the Personal God to the Impersonal, and at the same time to leave man as a person. So the personal man is broken down, and man as principle is built up. The person is only a phenomenon, the principle is  behind it. Thus from both sides, simultaneously, we",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************
******************"find the breaking down of personalities and the approach towards principles, the Personal God approaching the Impersonal, the personal man  approaching  the  Impersonal  Man.  Then  come  the  succeeding  stages  of  the  gradual convergence of the two advancing lines of the Impersonal God and the Impersonal Man. And  the Upanishads embody the stages through which these two lines at last become one, and the  last word of each Upanishad is, ""Thou art That"". There is but One Eternally Blissful Principle, and that One is manifesting Itself as all this variety.  Then came the philosophers. The work of the Upanishads seems to have ended at that point;  the next was taken up by the philosophers. The framework was given them by the Upanishads, and they had to fill in the details. So, many questions would naturally arise. Taking for granted that there is but One Impersonal Principle which is manifesting Itself in all these manifold forms, how is it that the One becomes many? It is another way",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************
******************"of putting the same old question which  in its crude form comes into the human heart as the inquiry into the cause of evil and so forth. Why does evil exist in the world, and what is its cause? But the same question has now become  refined, abstracted. No more is it asked from the platform of the senses why we are unhappy, but from the platform of philosophy. How is it that this One Principle becomes manifold? And  the answer, as we have seen, the best answer that India has produced is the theory of Maya which says that It really has not become manifold, that It really has not lost any of Its real nature. Manifoldness is only apparent. Man is only apparently a person, but in reality he is the  Impersonal Being. God is a person only apparently, but really He is the Impersonal Being.   Even in this answer there have been succeeding stages, and philosophers have varied in their opinions. All Indian philosophers did not admit this theory of Maya. Possibly most of them did not. There are",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************
******************"dualists, with a crude sort of dualism, who would not allow the question to be  asked, but stifled it at its very birth. They said, ""You have no right to ask such a question, you have no right to ask for an explanation; it is simply the will of God, and we have to submit to it  quietly. There is no liberty for the human soul. Everything is predestined — what we shall do, have, enjoy, and suffer; and when suffering comes, it is our duty to endure it patiently; if we do not, we shall be punished all the more. How do we know that? Because the Vedas say so."" And thus they have their texts and their meanings and they want to enforce them.   There are others who, though not admitting the Maya theory, stand midway. They say that the whole of this creation forms, as it were, the body of God. God is the Soul of all souls and of the whole of nature. In the case of individual souls, contraction comes from evil doing.

Others again, more thoughtful, bring in the theory of Maya and so forth. But  one fact stands out clearly, and it is with this that we have to deal. After all, these philosophical ideas and systems are but gymnastics of the mind, intellectual exercises. The one great idea that to me seems to be clear, and comes out through masses of superstition in every country and in every religion, is the one luminous idea that man is divine, that divinity is our nature.   Whatever else comes is a mere superimposition, as the Vedanta calls it. Something has been superimposed, but that divine nature never dies.

The people of old knew that fire lived in the flint and in dry wood, but friction  was necessary to call it out. So this fire of freedom and purity is the nature of every soul, and  not a quality, because qualities can be acquired and therefore can be lost. The soul is one with Freedom, and the soul is one with Existence, and the soul is one with Knowledge. The  Sat-Chit-Ânanda — Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute — is the nature, the birthright of the Soul, and all the manifestations that we see are Its expressions, dimly or brightly manifesting  Itself. Even death is but a manifestation of that Real Existence. Birth and death, life and decay, degeneration  and  regeneration  —  are  all  manifestations  of  that  Oneness.

This idea seems to be the most prominent in Vedanta, and, as I have said, it appears to me that every religion holds it. I have yet to know the religion which does not. It is the one universal  idea working through all religions. Take the Bible for instance. You find there the allegorical statement that the first man Adam was pure, and that his purity was obliterated by his evil deeds  afterwards. It is clear from this allegory that they thought that the nature of the primitive man was perfect. The impurities that we see, the weaknesses that",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************
******************"we feel, are but superimpositions on that nature, and the subsequent history of the Christian religion shows that they also believe  in the possibility, nay, the certainty of regaining that old state. This is the whole history of the Bible, Old and New Testaments together. So with the Mohammedans: they also believed in  Adam and the purity of Adam, and through Mohammed the way was opened to regain that lost state. So with the Buddhists: they believe in the state called Nirvana which is beyond this relative world. It is exactly the same as the Brahman of the Vedantins, and the whole system of the Buddhists is founded upon the idea of regaining that lost state of Nirvana. In every system we find this doctrine present, that you cannot get anything which is not yours already. You  are indebted to nobody in this universe. You claim your own birthright, as it has been most poetically expressed by a great Vedantin philosopher, in the title of one of his books — ""The attainment of our own",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************

This is the only difference.   Although all the systems agree so far that we had the empire, and that we have lost it, they give us varied advice as to how to regain it. One says that you must perform certain ceremonies, pay certain sums of money to certain idols, eat certain sorts of food, live in a peculiar fashion to ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************

Again, another says if you love such a Being with all your heart, you will regain that empire. All this varied advice is in the Upanishads. As I go on, you will find it so. But the last and the greatest counsel is that you need not weep  at all. You need not go through all these ceremonies, and need not take any notice of how to  regain your empire, because you never lost it. Why should you go to seek for what you never lost? You are pure already, you are free already. If you think you are free, free you are this moment, and if you think you are bound, bound you will be. This is a very bold statement, and as I told you at the beginning of this course, I shall have to speak to you very boldly. It may frighten you now, but when you think over it, and realise it in your own life, then you will  come to know that what I say is true.

******************"supposing that freedom is not your nature, by no manner of means can you become free. Supposing you were free and in some way you lost that freedom, that shows that you were not free to begin with. Had you been free, what could have made you lose it? The independent can never be made dependent; if it is really dependent, its  independence was a hallucination.  Of the two sides, then, which will you take? If you say that the soul was by its own nature pure  and free, it naturally follows that there was nothing in this universe which could make it bound or limited. But if there was anything in nature which could bind the soul, it naturally follows that it  was not free, and your statement that it was free is a delusion. So if it is possible for us to attain to freedom, the conclusion is inevitable that the soul is by its nature free. It cannot be otherwise. Freedom means independence of anything outside, and that means that nothing outside itself could work upon it as a cause.

But if it be true that the soul is  free, it naturally follows that nothing can affect it, and it can never die. Freedom, immortality, blessedness, all depend upon the soul being beyond the law of causation, beyond this Maya. Of these two which will you take? Either make the first a delusion, or make the second a delusion.  Certainly  I  will  make  the  second  a  delusion.  It  is  more  consonant  with  all  my  feelings  and aspirations.

******************"in all philosophies, in some form or other. Even in the most modern  philosophies you find the same discussion arising. There are two parties. One says that there is no soul, that the idea of soul is a delusion produced by the repeated transit of particles or  matter, bringing about the combination which you call the body or brain; that the impression of freedom is the result of the vibrations and motions and continuous transit of these particles. There were Buddhistic sects who held the same view and illustrated it by this example: If young take a torch and whirl it round rapidly, there will be a circle of light. That circle does not really exist, because the torch is changing place every moment. We are but bundles of little particles,  which in their rapid whirling produce the delusion of a permanent soul. The other party states that in the rapid succession of thought, matter occurs as a delusion, and does not really exist.

The arguments are similar for both, only on the spirit side the argument is little stronger. For nobody has ever seen what matter is. We can only feel ourselves. I never knew a man who could feel matter  outside of himself. Nobody was ever able to jump outside of himself. Therefore the argument is a little stronger on the side of the spirit. Secondly, the spirit theory explains the universe, whiles materialism does not. Hence the materialistic explanation is illogical.

******************" philosophies and analyse them, you will find that they are reduced to one; or the other of these two positions. So here, too, in a more intricate form, in a more philosophical form, we find the same question about natural purity and freedom. Ones side says that the first is a delusion, and the other, that the second is a delusion. And, of course, we side with the second, in believing  that our bondage is a delusion.  The solution of the Vedanta is that we are not bound, we are free already. Not only so, but to say or to think that we are bound is dangerous — it is a mistake, it is self-hypnotism. As soon as you say, ""I am bound,"" ""I am weak,"" ""I am helpless,"" woe unto you; you rivet one more chain upon yourself. Do not say it, do not think it.

You are He, and so am I."" That is - the position of strength. Nevertheless, there are great and wonderful things in the religions of the dualists; wonderful  is the idea of the Personal God apart from nature, whom we worship and love. Sometimes this idea is very soothing. But, says the Vedanta, the soothing is something like the effect that  comes from an opiate, not natural. It brings weakness in the long run, and what this world wants today, more than it ever did before, is strength. It is weakness, says the Vedanta, which is the cause of all misery in this world.

Through all these philosophical discussions and tremendous mental gymnastics we come to this one religious idea, the simplest  in the whole world.

The whole universe is beautiful, and man has been enjoying it since his appearance on earth. Sublime and awe-inspiring are the mountains; the gigantic rushing rivers rolling towards the sea, the trackless deserts, the infinite ocean, the starry heavens — all these are awe-inspiring, sublime, and beautiful indeed. The whole mass  of existence which we call nature has been acting on the human mind since time immemorial. It has been acting on the thought of man, and as its reaction has come out the question: What are these, whence are they? As far back as the time of the oldest portion of that most ancient  human  composition,  the  Vedas,  we  find  the  same  question  asked:  ""Whence  is  this?  When  there  was  neither  aught  nor  naught,  and  darkness  was ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************

Millions of attempts have been made to answer it, yet millions of times it will have to be answered again. It is not that each answer was a failure; every answer to this question contained a part of truth, and this truth gathers strength as time rolls on. I will try to present  before you the outline of the answer that I have gathered from the ancient philosophers of India; in harmony with modern knowledge.  We find that in this oldest of questions a few points had been already solved. The first is that  there was a time when there was ""neither aught nor naught"", when this world did not exist; our  mother earth with the seas and oceans, the rivers, and mountains, cities and villages human races, animals, plants, birds, and planets and luminaries, all this infinite variety of creation, had no existence. Are we sure of that? We will try to trace how",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************
******************"this conclusion is arrived at. What  does man see around him? Take a little plant. He puts a seed in the ground, and later, he finds a plant peep out, lift itself slowly above the ground, and grow and grow, till it becomes a gigantic  tree. Then it dies, leaving only the seed. It completes the circle — it comes out of the seed, becomes the tree, and ends in the seed again. Look at a bird, how from the egg it springs, lives its life, and then dies, leaving other eggs, seeds of future birds. So with the animals, so with  man. Everything in nature begins, as it were, from certain seeds, certain rudiments, certain fine forms, and becomes grosser and grosser, and develops, going on that way for a certain time, and then again goes back to that fine form, and subsides. The raindrop in which the beautiful sunbeam is playing was drawn in the form of vapour from the ocean, went far away into the air, and reached a region where it changed into water, and dropped down in its present form — to  be",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************

Again they will be pounded and pulverised, and thus the course goes on. From sand rise these mountains; unto sand they go.

Take up a little plant and study its life, and  we know the universe as it is. If we know one grain of sand, we understand the secret of the  whole universe. Applying this course of reasoning to phenomena, we find, in the first place, that everything is almost similar at the beginning and the end. The mountain comes from the sand, and goes back to the sand; the river comes out of vapour, and goes back to vapour; plant life comes from the seed, and goes back to the seed; human life comes out of human germs, and goes back to human germs.

******************"we learn from this? That the manifested or the grosser state is the effect, and the finer state the cause. Thousands of years ago, it was demonstrated by Kapila, the great father of all philosophy, that destruction means going back to the cause. If this table here is destroyed, it will go back to its cause, to those fine forms and particles which,  combined, made this form which we call a table. If a man dies, he will go back to the elements  which gave him his body; if this earth dies, it will go back to the elements which gave it form. This is what is called destruction, going back to the cause. Therefore we learn that the effect  is the same as the cause, not different. It is only in another form. This glass is an effect, and it had its cause, and this cause is present in this form. A certain amount of the material called  glass plus the force in the hands of the manufacturer, are the causes, the instrumental and the material, which, combined, produced this form called a glass. The",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************
******************"force which was in the hands of the manufacturer is present in the glass as the power of adhesion, without which the particles would fall apart; and the glass material is also present. The glass is only a manifestation of  these fine causes in a new shape, and if it be broken to pieces, the force which was present in the form of adhesion will go back and join its own element, and the particles of glass will remain  the same until they take new forms.   Thus we find that the effect is never different from the cause. It is only that this effect is a reproduction of the cause in a grosser form. Next, we learn that all these particular forms which we call plants, animals, or men are being repeated ad infinitum, rising and falling. The seed  produces the tree. The tree produces the seed, which again comes up as another tree, and so on and on; there is no end to it. Water-drops roll down the mountains into the ocean, and rise  again as vapour, go back to the mountains and again come down to",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************

Everything that is within the bounds of our knowledge is proceeding in the same way,  like breathing in and breathing out in the human body. Everything in creation goes on in this form, one wave rising, another falling, rising again, falling again. Each wave has its hollow, each  hollow has its wave. The same law must apply to the universe taken as a whole, because of its uniformity. This universe must be resolved into its causes; the sun, moon, stars, and earth, the body and mind, and everything in this universe must return to their finer causes, disappear, be destroyed as it were. But they will live in the causes as fine forms. Out of these fine forms they will emerge again as new earths, suns, moons, and stars.  There is one fact more to learn about this rising and falling.

We have seen that the cause is the same as the effect, and the effect is only the cause in another form. Therefore this whole universe cannot be produced out of nothing. Nothing comes without a  cause, and the cause is the effect in another form.  Out of what has this universe been produced then? From a preceding fine universe. Out of what has men been produced? The preceding fine form. Out of what has the tree been produced? Out  of  the  seed;  the  whole  of  the  tree  was  there  in  the  seed.  It  comes  out  and  becomes manifest. So, the whole of this universe has been created out of this very universe existing in  a minute form. It has been made manifest now. It will go back to that minute form, and again will be made manifest.

This is very true, perfectly true; we see it in our lives. No rational man can possibly quarrel with these evolutionists. But we have to learn one thing more. We have to go one step further, and  what is that? That every evolution is preceded by an involution. The seed is the father of the tree, but another tree was itself the father of the seed. The seed is the fine form out of which the  big tree comes, and another big tree was the form which is involved in that seed. The whole of this universe was present in the cosmic fine universe. The little cell, which becomes afterwards the man, was simply the involved man and becomes evolved as a man.

Everything exists through eternity, and will exist through eternity. Only the movement is in succeeding waves and hollows, going back  to fine forms, and coming out into gross manifestations. This involution and evolution is going on throughout the whole of nature. The whole series of evolution beginning with the lowest manifestation of life and reaching up to the highest, the most perfect man, must have been  the involution of something else. The question is: The involution of what? What was involved? God. The evolutionist will tell you that your idea that it was God is wrong. Why? Because you  see God is intelligent, but we find that intelligence develops much later on in the course of evolution.

We know that if we can find the beginning we can find the end. E converso, if we find the end we can find the beginning. If that is so, take this whole evolutionary series, from the protoplasm at one end to the perfect man at the other, and this whole series is one life. In the end we find the perfect man, so in the beginning it must have been the same. Therefore, the protoplasm was the involution of the highest intelligence.

******************" CHAPTER XII THE COSMOS: The Microcosm (Delivered in New York, 26th January 1896)   The human mind naturally wants to get outside, to peer out of the body, as it were, through the channels of the organs. The eye must see, the ear must hear, the senses must sense the external world — and naturally the beauties and sublimities of nature captivate the attention of man first. The first questions that arose in the human soul were about the external world. The solution of the mystery was asked of the sky, of the stars, of the heavenly bodies, of the  earth, of the rivers, of the mountains, of the ocean; and in all ancient religions we find traces of how the groping human mind at first caught at everything external. There was a river-god, a sky-god, a cloud-god, a rain-god; everything external, all of which we now call the powers of  nature, became metamorphosed, transfigured, into wills, into gods, into heavenly messengers.  As the question went deeper and deeper, these external",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [41-80]]]******************

The subject of discussion this afternoon is this internal man. No question is so near and dear to man's heart as that of the internal man. How many millions of times, in how many countries has  this question been asked!

******************" CHAPTER I THE NECESSITY OF RELIGION ( Delivered in London )   Of all the forces that have worked and are still working to mould the destinies of the human race, none, certainly, is more potent than that, the manifestation of which we call religion. All social organisations have as a background, somewhere, the workings of that peculiar force, and the greatest cohesive impulse ever brought into play amongst human units has been derived from this power. It is obvious to all of us that in very many cases the bonds of religion have  proved stronger than the bonds of race, or climate, or even of descent. It is a well-known fact that persons worshipping the same God, believing in the same religion, have stood by each other, with much greater strength and constancy, than people of merely the same descent, or  even brothers. Various attempts have been made to trace the beginnings of religion. In all the  ancient religions which have come down to us at the present day, we find one claim made —",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************"that they are all supernatural, that their genesis is not, as it were, in the human brain, but that  they have originated somewhere outside of it.  Two theories have gained some acceptance amongst modern scholars. One is the spirit  theory of religion, the other the evolution of the idea of the Infinite. One party maintains that ancestor worship is the beginning of religious ideas; the other, that religion originates in the  personification of the powers of nature. Man wants to keep up the memory of his dead relatives and thinks they are living even when the body is dissolved, and he wants to place food for them  and, in a certain sense, to worship them. Out of that came the growth we call religion.  Studying the ancient religions of the Egyptians, Babylonians, Chinese, and many other races in America and elsewhere, we find very clear traces of this ancestor worship being the beginning  of religion. With the ancient Egyptians, the first idea of the soul was that of a double. Every",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************"human body contained in it another being very similar to it; and when a man died, this double  went out of the body and yet lived on. But the life of the double lasted only so long as the dead body remained intact, and that is why we find among the Egyptians so much solicitude to keep the body uninjured. And that is why they built those huge pyramids in which they preserved the  bodies. For, if any portion of the external body was hurt, the double would be correspondingly injured. This is clearly ancestor worship. With the ancient Babylonians we find the same idea of the double, but with a variation. The double lost all sense of love; it frightened the living to give it food and drink, and to help it in various ways. It even lost all affection for its own children and its own wife. Among the ancient Hindus also, we find traces of this ancestor worship. Among  the Chinese, the basis of their religion may also be said to be ancestor worship, and it still permeates the length and breadth",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************"of that vast country. In fact, the only religion that can really be said to flourish in China is that of ancestor worship. Thus it seems, on the one hand, a very good position is made out for those who hold the theory of ancestor worship as the beginning of  religion.  On the other hand, there are scholars who from the ancient Aryan literature show that religion  originated in nature worship. Although in India we find proofs of ancestor worship everywhere, yet in the oldest records there is no trace of it whatsoever. In the Rig-Veda Samhitâ, the most ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************" ancient record of the Aryan race, we do not find any trace of it. Modern scholars think, it is the worship of nature that they find there. The human mind seems to struggle to get a peep behind the scenes. The dawn, the evening, the hurricane, the stupendous and gigantic forces of nature, its beauties, these have exercised the human mind, and it aspires to go beyond, to  understand something about them. In the struggle they endow these phenomena with personal  attributes, giving them souls and bodies, sometimes beautiful, sometimes transcendent. Every attempt ends by these phenomena becoming abstractions whether personalised or not. So also it is found with the ancient Greeks; their whole mythology is simply this abstracted nature worship. So also with the ancient Germans, the Scandinavians, and all the other Aryan races. Thus, on this side, too, a very strong case has been made out, that religion has its origin in the  personification of the powers of nature.  These two views, though",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************"they seem to be contradictory, can be reconciled on a third basis, which, to my mind, is the real germ of religion, and that I propose to call the struggle to  transcend the limitations of the senses. Either, man goes to seek for the spirits of his ancestors,  the spirits of the dead, that is, he wants to get a glimpse of what there is after the body is dissolved, or, he desires to understand the power working behind the stupendous phenomena  of nature. Whichever of these is the case, one thing is certain, that he tries to transcend the limitations of the senses. He cannot remain satisfied with his senses; he wants to go beyond  them. The explanation need not be mysterious. To me it seems very natural that the first glimpse of religion should come through dreams. The first idea of immortality man may well get through dreams. Is that not a most wonderful state? And we know that children and untutored minds find very little difference between dreaming and their awakened state. What can",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************"be more  natural than that they find, as natural logic, that even during the sleep state when the body is apparently dead, the mind goes on with all its intricate workings? What wonder that men will at  once come to the conclusion that when this body is dissolved for ever, the same working will go on? This, to my mind, would be a more natural explanation of the supernatural, and through this  dream idea the human mind rises to higher and higher conceptions. Of course, in time, the vast majority of mankind found out that these dreams are not verified by their waking states, and that during the dream state it is not that man has a fresh existence, but simply that he recapitulates  the experiences of the awakened state.   But by this time the search had begun, and the search was inward, arid man continued inquiring more deeply into the different stages of the mind and discovered higher states than either the waking or the dreaming.

******************"religions of the  world, called either ecstasy or inspiration. In all organised religions, their founders, prophets, and messengers are declared to have gone into states of mind that were neither waking nor  sleeping, in which they came face to face with a new series of facts relating to what is called the spiritual kingdom. They realised things there much more intensely than we realise facts around us in our waking state. Take, for instance, the religions of the Brahmins. The Vedas are said to be written by Rishis. These Rishis were sages who realised certain facts. The exact definition of the Sanskrit word Rishi is a Seer of Mantras — of the thoughts conveyed in the Vedic hymns.  These men declared that they had realised — sensed, if that word can be used with regard to the supersensuous — certain facts, and these facts they proceeded to put on record.

It may be asked — if the Buddhists do not believe in any God or soul, how can their  religion be derived from the supersensuous state of existence?

All his teachings came through this, and not through intellectual cogitations.   Thus, a tremendous statement is made by all religions; that the human mind, at certain moments, transcends not only the limitations of the senses, but also the power of reasoning. It then comes face to face with facts which it could never have sensed, could never hive reasoned out. These facts are the basis of all the religions of the world. Of course we have the right to challenge these facts, to put them to the test of reason. Nevertheless, all the existing religions of  the world claim for the human mind this peculiar power of transcending the limits of the senses and the limits of reason; and this power they put forward as a statement of fact.

******************"question how far these facts claimed by religions are true, we  find one characteristic common to them all. They are all abstractions as contrasted with the  concrete discoveries of physics, for instance; and in all the highly organised religions they take the purest form of Unit Abstraction, either in the form of an Abstracted Presence, as an  Omnipresent Being, as an Abstract Personality called God, as a Moral Law, or in the form of an Abstract Essence underlying every existence. In modern times, too, the attempts made to  preach religions without appealing to the supersensuous state if the mind have had to take up the old abstractions of the Ancients and give different names to them as ""Moral Law"", the ""Ideal Unity"", and so forth, thus showing that these abstractions are not in the senses. None of us have yet seen an ""Ideal Human Being"", and yet we are told to believe in it. None of us have yet  seen an ideally perfect man, and yet without that ideal we cannot progress. Thus, this",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************"one fact stands out from all these different religions, that there is an Ideal Unit Abstraction, which is put  before us, either in the form of a Person or an Impersonal Being, or a Law, or a Presence, or an Essence. We are always struggling to raise ourselves up to that ideal. Every human being,  whosoever and wheresoever he may be, has an ideal of infinite power. Every human being has an ideal of infinite pleasure. Most of the works that we find around us, the activities displayed everywhere, are due to the struggle for this infinite power or this infinite pleasure. But a few  quickly discover that although they are struggling for infinite power, it is not through the senses that it can be reached. They find out very soon that that infinite pleasure is not to be got through  the senses, or, in other words, the senses are too limited, and the body is too limited, to express the Infinite. To manifest the Infinite through the finite is impossible, and sooner or later, man learns to",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************"give up the attempt to express the Infinite through the finite. This giving up, this  renunciation of the attempt, is the background of ethics. Renunciation is the very basis upon which ethics stands. There never was an ethical code preached which had not renunciation for  its basis.  Ethics always says, ""Not I, but thou."" Its motto is, ""Not self, but non-self."" The vain ideas of individualism, to which man clings when he is trying to find that Infinite Power or that Infinite Pleasure through the senses, have to be given up — say the laws of ethics. You have to  put yourself last, and others before you. The senses say, ""Myself first."" Ethics says, ""I must hold myself last."" Thus, all codes of ethics are based upon this renunciation; destruction, not construction, of the individual on the material plane. That Infinite will never find expression upon  the material plane, nor is it possible or thinkable.  So, man has to give up the plane of matter and rise to other spheres to seek a",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************

They seem so very much ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************" afraid of losing what they call their individuality. At the same time, the same men would declare the highest ideals of ethics to be right, never for a moment thinking that the scope, the goal, the idea of all ethics is the destruction, and not the building up, of the individual.   Utilitarian standards cannot explain the ethical relations of men, for, in the first place, we cannot  derive any ethical laws from considerations of utility.

Without the struggle towards the Infinite there can be no ideal. Any system that wants to bind men down to the limits of their own societies is not able to find an explanation for the ethical laws of mankind.

******************" CHAPTER II THE REAL NATURE OF MAN ( Delivered in London )   Great is the tenacity with which man clings to the senses. Yet, however substantial he may think the external world in which he lives and moves, there comes a time in the lives of individuals and of races when, involuntarily, they ask, ""Is this real?"" To the person who never finds a moment to question the credentials of his senses, whose every moment is occupied with some sort of sense-enjoyment — even to him death comes, and he also is compelled to ask, ""Is this  real?"" Religion begins with this question and ends with its answer. Even in the remote past, where recorded history cannot help us, in the mysterious light of mythology, back in the dim twilight of civilisation, we find the same question was asked, ""What becomes of this? What is  real?""  One of the most poetical of the Upanishads, the Katha Upanishad, begins with the  inquiry: ""When a man dies, there is a dispute. One party declares that he has gone for ever, the",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************"other insists that he is still living. Which is true?"" Various answers have been given. The whole sphere of metaphysics, philosophy, and religion is really filled with various answers to  this question. At the same time, attempts have been made to suppress it, to put a stop to the unrest of mind which asks, ""What is beyond? What is real?"" But so long as death remains, all  these attempts at suppression will always prove to be unsuccessful. We may talk about seeing nothing beyond and keeping all our hopes and aspirations confined to the present moment,  and struggle hard not to think of anything beyond the world of senses; and, perhaps, everything  outside helps to keep us limited within its narrow bounds. The whole world may combine to prevent us from broadening out beyond the present. Yet, so long as there is death, the question must come again and again, ""Is death the end of all these things to which we are clinging, as  if they were the most real of all realities, the most",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************

Standing on the brink of a precipice beyond which is the  infinite yawning chasm, every mind, however hardened, is bound to recoil and ask, ""Is this real?"" The hopes of a lifetime, built up little by little with all the energies of a great mind, vanish in a second. Are they real? This question must be answered. Time never lessens its power; on  the other hand, it adds strength to it.  Then there is the desire to be happy. We run after everything to make ourselves happy; we pursue our mad career in the external world of senses. If you ask the young man with whom life is successful, he will declare that it is real; and he really thinks so. Perhaps, when the same  man grows old and finds fortune ever eluding him, he will then declare that it is fate. He finds at last that his desires cannot be fulfilled.

For we must remember that he who denies the past and the future and wants to stick to the present is simply a madman.

I have never seen a man who could really become a nihilist for one minute. It is very easy to talk.   Then there is the other position — to seek for an explanation, to seek for the real, to discover in  the midst of this eternally changing and evanescent world whatever is real. In this body which is an aggregate of molecules of matter, is there anything which is real? This has been the search throughout the history of the, human mind. In the very oldest times, we often find glimpses of light coming into men's minds. We find man, even then, going a step beyond this body, finding something which is not this external body, although very much like it, much more complete,  much more perfect, and which remains even when this body is dissolved.

It is a significant fact that all religions,  without one exception, hold that man is a degeneration of what he was, whether they clothe this in mythological words, or in the clear language of philosophy, or in the beautiful expressions of  poetry. This is the one fact that comes out of every scripture and of every mythology that the man that is, is a degeneration of what he was. This is the kernel of truth within the story of  Adam's fall in the Jewish scripture. This is again and again repeated in the scriptures of the Hindus; the dream of a period which they call the Age of Truth, when no man died unless he wished to die, when he could keep his body as long as he liked, and his mind was pure and strong.

It is going up slowly again to reach once more that early  state of purity. You are all aware of the story of the deluge in the Old Testament. The same story was current among the ancient Babylonians, the Egyptians, the Chinese, and the Hindus. Manu, a great ancient sage, was praying on the bank of the Gangâ, when a little minnow came  to him for protection, and he put it into a pot of water he had before him.

Manu put him in a tank, and the next day he was as big as the tank and declared he could not live there any more. So Manu had to take him to a  river, and in the morning the fish filled the river. Then Manu put him in the ocean, and he declared, ""Manu, I am the Creator of the universe. I have taken this form to come and warn you  that I will deluge the world. You build an ark and in it put a pair of every kind of animal, and let your family enter the ark, and there will project out of the water my horn. Fasten the ark to it; and when the deluge subsides, come out and people the earth."" So the world was deluged, and Manu saved his own family and two of every kind of animal and seeds of every plant. When the deluge subsided, he came and peopled the world; and we are all called ""man"", because we are  the progeny of Manu.  Now, human language is the attempt to express the truth that is within.

Evolutionists seem to contradict entirely this assertion. According to them, man is the evolution of the mollusc; and, therefore, what mythology states  cannot be true. There is in India, however, a mythology which is able to reconcile both these positions. The Indian mythology has a theory of cycles, that all progression is in the form of  waves. Every wave is attended by a fall, and that by a rise the next moment, that by a fall in the next, and again another rise The motion is in cycles.

Something cannot come out of nothing. Thus we are in the position of reconciling  the scriptures with modern light. That energy which manifests itself slowly through various stages until it becomes the perfect man, cannot come out of nothing. It existed somewhere; and if the mollusc or the protoplasm is the first point to which you can trace it, that protoplasm,  somehow or other, must have contained the energy.

What force is there which takes up material from the mass of matter around and forms my body  one way, another body another way, and so on? What makes these infinite distinctions?

A mass of air in vortex motion, as in a tornado,  becomes solid-like and by its impact breaks or cuts through solids. A thread of a spider's web, if it could be moved at almost infinite velocity, would be as strong as an iron chain and would cut through an oak tree.

******************" CHAPTER III MAYA AND ILLUSION ( Delivered in London )   Almost all of you have heard of the word Mâyâ. Generally it is used, though incorrectly, to denote illusion, or delusion, or some such thing. But the theory of Maya forms one of the pillars upon which the Vedanta rests; it is, therefore, necessary that it should be properly understood. I ask a little patience of you, for there is a great danger of its being misunderstood. The oldest idea of Maya that we find in Vedic literature is the sense of delusion; but then the real  theory had not been reached. We find such passages as, ""Indra through his Maya assumed various forms."" Here it is true the word Maya means something like magic, and we find various other passages, always taking the same meaning. The word Maya then dropped out of sight  altogether. But in the meantime the idea was developing. Later, the question was raised: ""Why  can't we know this secret of the universe?"" And the answer given was very significant: ""Because we",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************"talk in vain, and because we are satisfied with the things of the senses, and because we are  running after desires; therefore, we, as it were, cover the Reality with a mist."" Here the word Maya is not used at all, but we get the idea that the cause of our ignorance is a kind of mist that has come between us and the Truth. Much later on, in one of the latest Upanishads, we find the  word Maya reappearing, but this time, a transformation has taken place in it, and a mass of new meaning has attached itself to the word. Theories had been propounded and repeated, others  had been taken up, until at last the idea of Maya became fixed. We read in the Shvetâshvatara Upanishad, ""Know nature to be Maya and the Ruler of this Maya is the Lord Himself."" Coming  to our philosophers, we find that this word Maya has been manipulated in various fashions,  until we come to the great Shankarâchârya. The theory of Maya was manipulated a little by the Buddhists too, but in the hands of the Buddhists it",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************"became very much like what is called Idealism, and that is the meaning that is now generally given to the word Maya. When the  Hindu says the world is Maya, at once people get the idea that the world is an illusion. This interpretation has some basis, as coming through the Buddhistic philosophers, because there  was one section of philosophers who did not believe in the external world at all. But the Maya of the Vedanta, in its last developed form, is neither Idealism nor Realism, nor is it a theory. It is a simple statement of facts — what we are and what we see around us.  As I have told you before, the minds of the people from whom the Vedas came were intent upon following principles, discovering principles. They had no time to work upon details or to wait for them; they wanted to go deep into the heart of things. Something beyond was calling them, as it were, and they could not wait. Scattered through the Upanishads, we find that the  details of subjects which we now call modern",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************"sciences are often very erroneous, but, at the same time, their principles are correct. For instance, the idea of ether, which is one of the latest theories of modern science, is to be found in our ancient literature in forms much more developed than is the modern scientific theory of ether today, but it was in principle. When they  tried to demonstrate the workings of that principle, they made many mistakes. The theory of the all-pervading life principle, of which all life in this universe is but a differing manifestation, was understood in Vedic times; it is found in the Brâhmanas. There is a long hymn in the Samhitâs  in praise of Prâna of which all life is but a manifestation.

******************" very similar to those which have been advanced by some modern European scientists. You, of course, all know that there is a theory that life came from other planets. It is a settled doctrine with some Vedic philosophers that life comes in this way from the moon.   Coming to the principles, we find these Vedic thinkers very courageous and wonderfully bold in  propounding large and generalised theories. Their solution of the mystery of the universe, from the external world, was as satisfactory as it could be. The detailed workings of modern science do not bring the question one step nearer to solution, because the principles have failed. If the theory of ether failed in ancient times to give a solution of the mystery of the universe, working out the details of that ether theory would not bring us much nearer to the truth. If the theory of  all-pervading life failed as a theory of this universe, it would not mean anything more if worked out in detail, for the details do not change the",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************

They made some of the grandest generalizations that have yet been  reached, and some still remain as theories, which modern science has yet to get even as  theories. For instance, they not only arrived at the ether theory, but went beyond and classified mind also as a still more rarefied ether. Beyond that again, they found a still more rarefied ether.  Yet that was no solution, it did not solve the problem. No amount of knowledge of the external world could solve the problem. ""But"", says the scientist, ""we are just beginning to know a little:  wait a few thousand years and we shall get the solution.""

Every attempt to  solve the laws of causation, time, and space would be futile, because the very attempt would have to be made by taking for granted the existence of these three.

It exists only in relation to my mind, to your mind, and  to the mind of everyone else. We see this world with the five senses but if we had another sense, we would see in it something more. If we had yet another sense, it would appear as something still different. It has, therefore, no real existence; it has no unchangeable, immovable,  infinite existence.

All his work is in a  circle, and he cannot go beyond that circle. The problems which are nearest and dearest to him are impelling him on and calling, day and night, for a solution, but he cannot solve them, because he cannot go beyond his intellect. And yet that desire is implanted strongly in him. Still we know that the only good is to be obtained by controlling and checking it. With every breath, every impulse of our heart asks us to be selfish. At the same time, there is some power beyond  us which says that it is unselfishness alone which is good.

I do not  fear cold and hunger; therefore do not bring these horrible pictures before me."" But, on the other  hand, there are others dying of cold and hunger. If you go and teach them that it is all good, they will not hear you. How can they wish others to be happy when they are miserable? Thus we are oscillating between optimism and pessimism.  Then, there is the tremendous fact of death. The whole world is going towards death; everything  dies.

Help the widows on the other; they are suffering. It is like chronic rheumatism: you drive from the  head, and it goes to the body; you drive it from there, and it goes to the feet. Reformers arise and preach that learning, wealth, and culture should not be in the hands of a select few; and they do their best to make them accessible to all. These may bring more happiness to some,  but, perhaps, as culture comes, physical happiness lessens. The knowledge of happiness brings the knowledge of unhappiness. Which way then shall we go? The least amount of material prosperity that we enjoy is causing the same amount of misery elsewhere. This is the  law.

Even to grasp it, to draw an exact image of it in our own mind, is beyond our power. How can we solve it then?   Maya is a statement of the fact of this universe, of how it is going on. People generally get  frightened when these things are told to them. But bold we must be. Hiding facts is not the way to find a remedy. As you all know, a hare hunted by dogs puts its head down and thinks itself safe; so, when we run into optimism; we do just like the hare, but that is no remedy. There are objections against this, but you may remark that they are generally from people who possess many of the good things of life. In this country (England) it is very difficult to become  a pessimist. Everyone tells me how wonderfully the world is going on, how progressive; but what he himself is, is his own world.

Suppose the whole world were to become Christian,  then the Christian nations would become poor, because there would be no non-Christian nations for them to prey upon. Thus the argument kills itself. Animals are living upon plants,  men upon animals and, worst of all, upon one another, the strong upon the weak. This is going on everywhere. And this is Maya. What solution do you find for this? We hear every day many  explanations, and are told that in the long run all will be good. Taking it for granted that this is possible, why should there be this diabolical way of doing good?

That is very nice to  hear, and it panders to the vanity of those who have enough of this world's goods, who have not a hard struggle to face every clay and are not being crushed under the wheel of this so-called evolution. It is very good and comforting indeed to such fortunate ones. The common herd may  surfer, but they do not care; let them die, they are of no consequence. Very good, yet this argument is fallacious from beginning to end. It takes for granted, in the first place, that  manifested good and evil in this world are two absolute realities.

Very easy to say, but can it be proved that evil is a lessening quantity? Take, for instance, the  man who lives in a forest, who does not know how to cultivate the mind, cannot read a book, has not heard of such a thing as writing. If he is severely wounded, he is soon all right again; while we die if we get a scratch. Machines are making things cheap, making for progress and evolution, but millions are crushed, that one may become rich; while one becomes rich, thousands at the same time become poorer and poorer, and whole masses of human beings  are made slaves. That way it is going on. The animal man lives in the senses. If he does not get enough to eat, he is miserable; or if something happens to his body, he is miserable.

The nerves become finer and capable off more suffering. In every society, we often find that the ignorant, common man, when abused, does not feel much, but he feels a good thrashing. But the gentleman cannot bear a single word of  abuse; he has become so finely nerved. Misery has increased with his susceptibility to  happiness. This does not go much to prove the evolutionist's case. As we increase our power to be happy, we also increase our power to suffer, and sometimes I am inclined to think that if we increase our power to become happy in arithmetical progression, we shall increase, on the other hand, our power to become miserable in geometrical progression. We who are progressing know that the more we progress, the more avenues are opened to pain as well as  to pleasure. And this is Maya.

Nor can this  state of things be remedied. We may verily imagine that there will be a place where there will be only good and no evil, where we shall only smile and never weep. This is impossible in the  very nature of things; for the conditions will remain the same. Wherever there is the power of producing a smile in us, there lurks the power of producing tears. Wherever there is the power of producing happiness, there lurks somewhere the power of making us miserable.   Thus the Vedanta philosophy is neither optimistic nor pessimistic. It voices both these views and takes things as they",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************

There will never be a perfectly good or bad world, because the very idea is a contradiction in terms. The  great secret revealed by this analysis is that good and bad are not two cut-and-dried, separate existences. There is not one thing in this world of ours which you can label as good and good alone, and there is not one thing in the universe which you can label as bad and bad alone. The  very same phenomenon which is appearing to be good now, may appear to be bad tomorrow. The same thing which is producing misery in one, may produce happiness in another. The fire  that burns the child, may cook a good meal for a starving man. The same nerves that carry the sensations of misery carry also the sensations of happiness.

Life without death and happiness without misery are contradictions, and neither can be found alone, because each of them is but a different manifestation of the same thing. What I  thought to be good yesterday, I do not think to be good now. When I look back upon my life and see what were my ideals at different times, I final this to be so. At one time my ideal was to drive a strong pair of horses; at another time I thought, if I could make a certain kind of sweetmeat, I should be perfectly happy; later I imagined that I should be entirely satisfied if I had a wife and children and plenty of money. Today I laugh at all these ideals as mere childish nonsense.  The Vedanta says, there must come a time when we shall look back and laugh at the ideals which make us afraid of giving up our individuality. Each one of us wants to keep this body  for an indefinite time, thinking we shall be very happy, but there will come a time when we shall laugh at this idea.

******************" be misery, people will ask you, ""What is the use of doing good?"" The answer is in the first place, that we must work for lessening misery, for that is the only way to make ourselves happy. Every one of us finds it out sooner or later in our lives. The bright ones find it out a little earlier, and the dull ones a little later. The dull ones pay very dearly for the discovery and the bright ones less  dearly. In the second place, we must do our part, because that is the only way of getting out of  this life of contradiction. Both the forces of good and evil will keep the universe alive for us, until we awake from our dreams and give up this building of mud pies. That lesson we shall have to learn, and it will take a long, long time to learn it.  Attempts have been made in Germany to build a system of philosophy on the basis that the  Infinite has become the finite. Such attempts are also made in England. And the analysis of the position of these philosophers is this, that the Infinite",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************"is trying to express itself in this universe, and that there will come a time when the Infinite will succeed in doing so. It is all very well, and we have used the words Infinite and manifestation and expression, and so on, but philosophers  naturally ask for a logical fundamental basis for the statement that the finite can fully express  the Infinite. The Absolute and the Infinite can become this universe only by limitation. Everything must be limited that comes through the senses, or through the mind, or through the intellect;  and for the limited to be the unlimited is simply absurd and can never be. The Vedanta, on the other hand, says that it is true that the Absolute or the Infinite is trying to express itself in the  finite, but there will come a time when it will find that it is impossible, and it will then have to beat a retreat, and this beating a retreat means renunciation which is the real beginning of religion.

So says, perhaps, the English philosopher. Yet it is true that that is the only path to religion. Renounce and give up. What did Christ say? ""He that loseth his life for my sake shall  find it."" Again and again did he preach renunciation as the only way to perfection. There comes a time when the mind awakes from this long and dreary dream — the child gives up its play and  wants to go back to its mother. It finds the truth of the statement, ""Desire is never satisfied by the enjoyment of desires, it only increases the more, as fire, when butter is poured upon it.""   This is true of all sense-enjoyments, of all intellectual enjoyments, and of all the enjoyments of which the human mind is capable.

******************"whenever we struggle to get a little enjoyment, a mass of misery falls upon us. How awful is this! And when I think of it, I cannot but consider that this theory of Maya, this statement that it is all  Maya, is the best and only explanation. What an amount of misery there is in this world; and if you travel among various nations you will find that one nation attempts to cure its evils by one  means, and another by another. The very same evil has been taken up by various races, and attempts have been made in various ways to check it, yet no nation has succeeded. If it has been minimised at one point, a mass of evil has been crowded at another point. Thus it goes. The Hindus, to keep up a high standard of chastity in the race, have sanctioned child-marriage, which in the long run has degraded the race. At the same time, I cannot deny that this child- marriage makes the race more chaste. What would you have?

Do you not find in history  that the first death-sign of a nation has been unchastity? When that has entered, the end of the race is in sight. Where shall we get a solution of these miseries then? If parents select husbands and wives for their children, then this evil is minimised. The daughters of India are  more practical than sentimental. But very little of poetry remains in their lives. Again, if people select their own husbands and wives, that does not seem to bring much happiness.

What does it show? That, after all, not much happiness has been gained by all these ideals. We all struggle for happiness and as soon as we get a little happiness on one side, on the other side  there comes unhappiness.  Shall we not work to do good then? Yes, with more zest than ever, but what this knowledge will do for us is to break down our fanaticism. The Englishman will no more be a fanatic and curse the Hindu. He will learn to respect the customs of different nations. There will be less of fanaticism and more of real work. Fanatics cannot work, they waste three-fourths of their  energy. It is the level-headed, calm, practical man who works. So, the power to work will increase from this idea. Knowing that this is the state of things, there will be more patience.

If, for instance, all men have become good, the animals will have in the meantime  evolved into men, and will have to pass through the same state, and so with the plants. But only one thing is certain; the mighty river is rushing towards the ocean, and all the drops that  constitute the stream will in time be drawn into that boundless ocean. So, in this life, with all its miseries and sorrows, its joys and smiles and tears, one thing is certain, that all things are  rushing towards their goal, and it: is only a question of time when you and I, and plants and animals, and every particles of life that exists must reach the Infinite Ocean of Perfection, must attain to Freedom, to God.

This is the world, and knowing this, you work with patience. What for? Why should we work? If this is the state of  things, what shall we do? Why not become agnostics? The modern agnostics also know there is no solution of this problem, no getting out of this evil of Maya, as we say in our language; therefore they tell us to be satisfied and enjoy life. Here, again, is a mistake, a tremendous  mistake, a most illogical mistake. And it is this. What do you mean by life? Do you mean only the life of the senses? In this, every one of us differs only slightly from the brutes. I am sure that  no one is present here whose life is only in the senses. Then, this present life means something more than that.

******************"most important  components of what we call life? According to the agnostics, we must enjoy life as it is. But this life means, above all, this search after the ideal; the essence of life is going towards perfection.  We must have that, and, therefore, we cannot be agnostics or take the world as it appears. The agnostic position takes this life, minus the ideal component, to be all that exists. And this, the agnostic claims, cannot be reached, therefore he must give up the search. This is what is called Maya — this nature, this universe.   All religions are more or less attempts to get beyond nature — the crudest or the most developed, expressed through mythology or symbology, stories of gods, angels or demons, or through stories of saints or seers, great men or prophets, or through the abstractions of  philosophy — all have that one object, all are trying to get beyond these limitations.

If a door is closed, he thinks the gods can get through it, and  that walls have no limitations for them. This idea of freedom increases until it comes to the ideal  of a Personal God, of which the central concept is that He is a Being beyond the limitation of nature, of Maya. I see before me, as it were, that in some of those forest retreats this question is being, discussed by those ancient sages of India; and in one of them, where even the oldest and the holiest fail to reach the solutions a young man stands up in the midst of them, and declares, ""Hear, ye children of immortality, hear, who live in the highest places, I have found the  way.

The way is not with Maya, but against it. This is another fact to learn. We are not born as helpers of nature, but competitors with nature. We are its bond-masters, but  we bind ourselves down. Why is this house here? Nature did not build it. Nature says, go and live in the forest. Man says, I will build a house and fight with nature, and he does so. The whole  history of humanity is a continuous fight against the so-called laws of nature, and man gains in the end.

The idea of a Personal God, the Ruler and Creator of this universe, as He has been styled, the Ruler of Maya, or nature, is not the end of these Vedantic ideas; it is only the beginning. The idea grows and grows until the Vedantist finds that He who, he thought,  was standing outside, is he himself and is in reality within.

******************" CHAPTER IV MAYA AND THE EVOLUTION OF THE CONCEPTION OF GOD ( Delivered in London, 20th October 1896 )  We have seen how the idea of Mâyâ, which forms, as it were, one of the basic doctrines of the Advaita Vedanta, is, in its germs, found even in the Samhitâs, and that in reality all the ideas  which are developed in the Upanishads are to be found already in the Samhitas in some form or other. Most of you are by this time familiar with the idea of Maya, and know that it is sometimes erroneously explained as illusion, so that when the universe is said to be Maya, that also has to be explained as being illusion. The translation of the word is neither happy nor correct. Maya is not a theory; it is simply a statement of facts about the universe as it exists, and to understand  Maya we must go back to the Samhitas and begin with the conception in the germ.  We have seen how the idea of the Devas came. At the same time we know that these Devas were at first only powerful beings, nothing",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************"more. Most of you are horrified when reading the old  scriptures, whether of the Greeks, the Hebrews, the Persians, or others, to find that the ancient gods sometimes did things which, to us, are very repugnant. But when we read these books,  we entirely forget that we are persons of the nineteenth century, and these gods were beings existing thousands of years ago. We also forget that the people who worshipped these gods found nothing incongruous in their characters, found nothing to frighten them, because they  were very much like themselves. I may also remark that that is the one great lesson we have to learn throughout our lives. In judging others we always judge them by our own ideals. That is not as it should be. Everyone must be judged according to his own ideal, and not by that of  anyone else. In our dealings with our fellow-beings we constantly labour under this mistake, and I am of opinion that the vast majority of our quarrels with one another arise simply from this one ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************"cause that we are always trying to judge others' gods by our own, others' ideals by our ideals, and others' motives by our motives. Under certain circumstances I might do a certain thing, and when I see another person taking the same course I think he has also the same motive actuating him, little dreaming that although the effect may be the same, yet many other causes  may produce the same thing. He may have performed the action with quite a different motive  from that which impelled me to do it. So in judging of those ancient religions we must not take the standpoint to which we incline, but must put ourselves into the position of thought and life of those early times.  The idea of the cruel and ruthless Jehovah in the Old Testament has frightened many — but why? What right have they to assume that the Jehovah of the ancient Jews must represent the conventional idea of the God of the present day? And at the same time, we must not forget that there will come men after us who will",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************"laugh at our ideas of religion and God in the same way that we laugh at those of the ancients. Yet, through all these various conceptions runs  the golden thread of unity, and it is the purpose of the Vedanta to discover this thread. ""I am  the thread that runs through all these various ideas, each one of which is; like a pearl,"" says the Lord Krishna; and it is the duty of Vedanta to establish this connecting thread, how ever incongruous or disgusting may seem these ideas when judged according to the conceptions  of today.

For the old surroundings are dead and gone. Just as the ancient Jew has developed into the keen, modern, sharp Jew, and the ancient Aryan into the intellectual Hindu similarly Jehovah has grown, and Devas have  grown.  The great mistake is in recognising the evolution of the worshippers, while we do not acknowledge the evolution of the Worshipped. He is not credited with the advance that his devotees have made. That is to say, you and I, representing ideas, have grown; these gods also, as representing ideas, have grown. This may seem somewhat curious to you — that God  can grow. He cannot. He is unchangeable. In the same sense the real man never grows. But man's ideas of God are constantly changing and expanding.

******************"pure, and always perfect; and in the same way the idea that we form of God is a mere manifestation, our  own creation. Behind that is the real God who never changes, the ever pure, the immutable.  But the manifestation is always changing revealing the reality behind more and more. When it reveals more of the fact behind, it is called progression, when it hides more of the fact behind,  it is called retrogression. Thus, as we grow, so the gods grow. From the ordinary point of view, just as we reveal ourselves as we evolve, so the gods reveal themselves.  We shall now be in a position to understand the theory of Maya. In all the regions of the world the one question they propose to discuss is this: Why is there disharmony in the universe? Why is there this evil in the universe? We do not find this question in the very inception of  primitive religious ideas, because the world did not appear incongruous to the primitive man.

The primitive man was a man of impulse. He  did what occurred to him, and tried to bring out through his muscles whatever thought came into his mind, and he never stopped to judge, and seldom tried to check his impulses. So with the gods, they were also creatures of impulse. Indra comes and shatters the forces of the demons.  Jehovah is pleased with one person and displeased with another, for what reason no one knows or asks. The habit of inquiry had not then arisen, and whatever he did was regarded as right.  There was no idea of good or evil. The Devas did many wicked things in our sense of the word; again and again Indra and other gods committed very wicked deeds, but to the worshippers of Indra the ideas of wickedness and evil did not occur, so they did not question them.  With the advance of ethical ideas came the",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************"fight. There arose a certain sense in man, called  in different languages and nations by different names. Call it the voice of God, or the result of past education, or whatever else you like, but the effect was this that it had a checking power upon the natural impulses of man. There is one impulse in our minds which says, do. Behind it rises another voice which says, do not. There is one set of ideas in our mind which is always struggling to get outside through the channels of the senses, and behind that, although  it may be thin and weak, there is an infinitely small voice which says, do not go outside.

******************" these gods loved their tribes and each god was a tribal god, the protector of that tribe. And sometimes the members of a tribe would think of themselves as the descendants of their god, just as the clans in different nations think that they are the common descendants of the man who was the founder of the clan. There were in ancient times, and are even now, some people  who claim to be descendants not only of these tribal gods, but also of the Sun and the Moon.  You read in the ancient Sanskrit books of the great heroic emperors of the solar and the lunar dynasties. They were first worshippers of the Sun and the Moon, and gradually came to think of themselves as descendants of the god of the Sun of the Moon, and so forth. So when these tribal ideas began to grow there came a little love, some slight idea of duty towards each other, a little social organisation. Then, naturally, the idea came: How can we live together without  bearing and forbearing? How can one man live with another",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************

Thus comes the idea of restraint. The whole social fabric is based upon that idea of restraint, and we all know that the man or woman who has not learnt  the great lesson of bearing and forbearing leads a most miserable life.  Now, when these ideas of religion came, a glimpse of something higher, more ethical, dawned  upon the intellect of mankind. The old gods were found to be incongruous — these boisterous, fighting, drinking, beef-eating gods of the ancients — whose delight was in the smell of burning  flesh and libations of strong liquor. Sometimes Indra drank so much that he fell upon the ground and talked unintelligibly. These gods could no longer be tolerated. The notion had arisen of inquiring into motives, and the gods had to come in for their share of inquiry.

The god to be worshipped was no more a simple symbol of  power; something more was required than that. He was an ethical god; he loved mankind, and did good to mankind. But the idea of god still remained. They increased his ethical significance, and increased also his power. He became the most ethical being in the universe, as well as  almost almighty.   But all this patchwork would not do. As the explanation assumed greater proportions, the difficulty which it sought to solve did the same.

Why should  good come through evil? The question remains to be answered, and it cannot be answered. The philosophy of India was compelled to admit this.  The Vedanta was (and is) the boldest system of religion. It stopped nowhere, and it had one advantage. There was no body of priests who sought to suppress every man who tried to tell  the truth.

In India, on  the other hand, if a man dines with one who does not belong to his own caste, down comes society with all its terrible powers and crushes him then and there. If he wants to dress a little  differently from the way in which his ancestor dressed ages ago, he is done for.

I remember a friend of mine, a great American scientist, who was fond of reading his life. He did not like the death of Buddha, because he was not crucified.  What a false idea! For a man to be great he must be murdered! Such ideas never prevailed in India. This great Buddha travelled all over India, denouncing her gods and even the God of the universe, and yet he lived to a good old age. For eighty years he lived, and had converted half  the country.   Then, there were the Chârvâkas, who preached horrible things, the most rank, undisguised materialism, such as in the nineteenth century they dare not openly preach. These Charvakas were allowed to preach from temple to temple, and city to city, that religion was all nonsense,  that it was priestcraft, that the Vedas were the words and writings of fools, rogues, and demons, and that",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************

Thus India has always had this magnificent idea of religious freedom, and you must remember  that freedom is the first condition of growth. What you do not make free, will never grow.

But every one of us comes into this world to fight, as on a battlefield. We come here weeping to fight our way, as well as we can, and to make a path for ourselves through this infinite ocean of life; forward we go, having long ages behind us and an immense expanse beyond. So on we go,  till death comes and takes us off the field — victorious or defeated, we do not know. And this is Mâyâ.   Hope is dominant in the heart of childhood.

The child  grows up, perhaps becomes a drunkard, a brute, ill-treats the mother, and the more he ill-treats her, the more her love increases. The world lauds it as the unselfish love of the mother, little dreaming that the mother is a born slave, she cannot help it. She would a thousand times rather throw off the burden, but she cannot. So she covers it with a mass of flowers, which she calls wonderful love. And this is Maya.  We are all like this in the world. A legend tells how once Nârada said to Krishna, ""Lord, show me Maya.""

All that day he did not return to his Master. The next day, he was  again at the house, talking to the girl. That talk ripened into love; he asked the father for the daughter, and they were married and lived there and had children. Thus twelve years passed. His father-in-law died, he inherited his property.

In trying to save that child, he lost his grasp upon one of the others, and it also was lost. At last his wife, whom he clasped with all his  might, was torn away by the current, and he was thrown on the bank, weeping and wailing in bitter lamentation.

The question was practically this: ""What is this universe? From what does it arise? Into what does it go?"" And the answer was: ""In freedom  it rises, in freedom it rests, and into freedom it melts away."" This idea of freedom you cannot relinquish. Your actions, your very lives will be lost without it.

He himself cannot pass through a wall, nor fly up into the skies, but the gods whom he worships can do these things. What is meant by that,  philosophically? That the assertion of freedom is there, that the gods whom he worships are superior to nature as he knows it. So with those who worship still higher beings. As the idea of  nature expands, the idea of the soul which is superior to nature also expands, until we come to what we call monotheism, which holds that there is Maya (nature), and that there is some Being who is the Ruler of this Maya.

******************" CHAPTER VI THE ABSOLUTE AND MANIFESTATION ( Delivered in London, 1896 )   The one question that is most difficult to grasp in understanding the Advaita philosophy, and the one question that will be asked again and again and that will always remain is: How has the Infinite, the Absolute, become the finite? I will now take up this question, and, in order to illustrate it, I will use a figure.   Here is the Absolute (a), and this is the universe (b). The Absolute has become the universe.By this is not only meant the material world, but the mental world, the spiritual world —  heavens and earths, and in fact, everything that exists. Mind is  the name of a change, and body the name of another change, and so on, and all these changes compose our universe. This  Absolute (a) has become the universe (b) by coming through time, space, and causation (c). This is the central idea of Advaita. Time, space, and causation are like the glass through which the  Absolute is seen, and when It is seen",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************"on the lower side, It appears as the universe. Now we at once gather from this that in  the Absolute there is neither time, space, nor causation. The idea of time cannot be there, seeing that there is no mind, no thought.  The idea of space cannot be there, seeing that there is no  external change. What you call motion and causation cannot exist where there is only One. We have to understand this, and impress it on our minds, that what we call causation begins after, if we may be permitted to say  so, the degeneration of the Absolute into the phenomenal, and not before; that our will, our desire and all these things always come after that. I think Schopenhauer's philosophy makes a  mistake in its interpretation of Vedanta, for it seeks to make the will everything. Schopenhauer makes the will stand in the place of the Absolute. But the absolute cannot be presented as will, for will is something changeable and phenomenal, and over the line, drawn above time, space,  and causation, there",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************"is no change, no motion; it is only below the line that external motion and internal motion, called thought begin. There can be no will on the other side, and will therefore, cannot be the cause of this universe. Coming nearer, we see in our own bodies that will is not the cause of every movement. I move this chair; my will is the cause of this movement, and this will becomes manifested as muscular motion at the other end. But the same power that moves  the chair is moving the heart, the lungs, and so on, but not through will. Given that the power is the same, it only becomes will when it rises to the plane of consciousness, and to call it will before it has risen to this plane is a misnomer. This makes a good deal of confusion in Schopenhauer's philosophy.  A stone falls and we ask, why? This question is possible only on the supposition that nothing happens without a cause. I request you to make this very clear in your minds, for whenever we  ask why anything happens, we are taking",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************"for granted that everything that happens must have a why, that is to say, it must have been preceded by something else which acted as the cause. ",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************" This precedence and succession are what we call the law of causation. It means that everything in the universe is by turn a cause and an effect. It is the cause of certain things which come after it, and is itself the effect of something else which has preceded it. This is called the law of causation and is a necessary condition of all our thinking. We believe that every particle in the  universe, whatever it be, is in relation to every other particle. There has been much discussion  as to how this idea arose. In Europe, there have been intuitive philosophers who believed that it was constitutional in humanity, others have believed it came from experience, but the question has never been settled. We shall see later on what the Vedanta has to say about it. But first we have to understand this that the very asking of the question ""why"" presupposes that everything round us has been preceded by certain things and will be succeeded by certain other things.  The other belief involved in",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************"this question is that nothing in the universe is independent, that everything is acted upon by something outside itself. Interdependence is the law of the whole universe. In asking what caused the Absolute, what an error we are making! To ask this question we have to suppose that the Absolute also is bound by something, that It is dependent  on something; and in making this supposition, we drag the Absolute down to the level of the  universe. For in the Absolute there is neither time, space, nor causation; It is all one. That which exists by itself alone cannot have any cause. That which is free cannot have any cause; else it  would not be free, but bound. That which has relativity cannot be free. Thus we see the very question, why the Infinite became the finite, is an impossible one, for it is self-contradictory.  Coming from subtleties to the logic of our common plane, to common sense, we can see this from another side, when we seek to know how the Absolute has become the relative.",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: jnanayogaswamivivekanandabook1899 [1-40]]]******************
******************"Supposing we knew the answer, would the Absolute remain the Absolute? It would have become relative. What is meant by knowledge in our common-sense idea? It is only something  that has become limited by our mind, that we know, and when it is beyond our mind, it is not knowledge. Now if the Absolute becomes limited by the mind, It is no more Absolute; It has  become finite. Everything limited by the mind becomes finite. Therefore to know the Absolute is again a contradiction in terms. That is why this question has never been answered, because if it  were answered, there would no more be an Absolute. A God known is no more God; He has become finite like one of us. He cannot be known He is always the Unknowable One.   But what Advaita says is that God is more than knowable. This is a great fact to learn. You must not go home with the idea that God is unknowable in the sense in which agnostics put it. For  instance, here is a chair, it is known to us.

This chair is known, but God  is intensely more than that because in and through Him we have to know this chair itself. He is the Witness, the eternal Witness of all knowledge. Whatever we know we have to know in and through Him. He is the Essence of our own Self. He is the Essence of this ego, this I and we cannot know anything excepting in and through that I. Therefore you have to know everything in and through the Brahman. To know the chair you have to know it in and through God.

******************" # The Universal Experience of Nihilism: An Interdisciplinary and CrossCultural Exploration Abstract This comprehensive study delves into the universal experience of nihilism as reflected in the thoughts and writings of 51 influential thinkers from diverse historical eras, geographic regions, cultures, political systems, and  religious traditions. Through an iterative analysis of their quotations, we  explore how themes of existential struggle, meaninglessness, and spiritual despair manifest across different human experiences. The study is structured  into five thematic categories, each exhaustively examined to reveal the shared human confrontation with nihilism. By employing a rigorous and reflective methodology, we demonstrate that nihilism transcends historical, cultural, and  ideological boundaries, affirming it as a fundamental aspect of the human condition. --## Introduction Nihilism, the philosophical viewpoint that life lacks inherent meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value,",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: universalnihilism1]]******************
******************"has pervaded human thought across civilizations and epochs. From ancient philosophers to modern existentialists, the  confrontation with the void has been a recurring theme. This study aims to demonstrate the universality of nihilism by analyzing quotations from a diverse array of thinkers. By systematically and iteratively exploring their  reflections, we reveal how the experience of nihilism is a shared human phenomenon that transcends cultural, religious, and temporal boundaries. --## Methodology Our analysis is organized into five thematic categories: 1. The Human Condition and Existential Struggle 2. Human Nature: Identity, Dualities, and Growth 3. Spiritual Practices: Renunciation, Mysticism, and Transcendence 4. Mysticism, Suffering, and Transcendence 5. The Divine: Conceptualization, Practices, and Misconceptions",[[human]] [[experience]] [[existence]],[[pdf: universalnihilism1]]******************
******************" Each category undergoes multiple iterations and reflections, allowing us to refine and deepen our understanding. We extract and analyze quotations from 51  key thinkers, ensuring a comprehensive exploration. The iterative process  enables us to adjust our insights as patterns of nihilism emerge, culminating in a saturated text that exhausts all key entities. --- ## Category 1: The Human Condition and Existential Struggle This category explores the core dilemmas of human existence, focusing on universal themes of existential anxiety, the lack of inherent meaning, and the skepticism of knowledge. ### Iteration 1 #### 1.1 Anxiety Reflection 1: Søren Kierkegaard articulates existential anxiety as an inherent aspect of human freedom.

Through an iterative analysis of their quotations, we  explore how themes of existential struggle, meaninglessness, and spiritual despair manifest across different human experiences. The study is structured  into five thematic categories, each thoroughly examined to reveal the shared human confrontation with nihilism. By employing a rigorous and reflective methodology, we demonstrate that nihilism transcends historical, cultural, and  ideological boundaries, affirming it as a fundamental aspect of the human condition. --## Introduction Nihilism, the philosophical viewpoint that life lacks inherent meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value, has",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: universalnihilism3]]******************

Across cultures and  eras, thinkers have grappled with the unsettling aspects of the human  condition, expressing a shared sense of unease and questioning the very foundations of existence.

******************" --### Expanded Core Ideas #### Idea 1: Existential Anxiety as a Universal Experience Across various cultures, existential anxiety manifests as a response to life's uncertainties and inherent freedoms. Søren Kierkegaard describes it as ""the dizziness of freedom,"" illustrating how limitless choices can paralyze individuals. Similarly, Martin Heidegger's concept of *Angst* reflects a  deep-seated anxiety unveiling the nothingness at the core of existence. In Buddhism, the acknowledgment of *Dukkha* (suffering) underscores a universal discomfort with impermanence. This shared anxiety drives individuals  to seek meaning in an unpredictable world. #### Idea 2: Confrontation with Meaninglessness The existential vacuum created by the perceived lack of inherent meaning is a common human experience. Friedrich Nietzsche's declaration that ""God is dead"" symbolizes the loss of absolute values, leaving humanity adrift. Albert Camus explores the absurdity of life, stating, ""The",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[pdf: universalnihilism3]]******************
******************"absurd is born  of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world."" In Eastern thought, Taoism suggests that striving for meaning  through conventional means is futile, advocating harmony with the Tao instead. #### Idea 3: Skepticism Toward Absolute Knowledge From Socrates' admission of ignorance to Blaise Pascal's musings on reason's limitations, skepticism about absolute knowledge pervades  philosophical thought. Michel de Montaigne embodies this with ""Que sçayje?"" (""What do I know?""). In Hinduism, the concept of *Maya* implies that  the perceived world is an illusion, and true knowledge is beyond ordinary perception. Such universal doubt highlights the human struggle to attain certainty. --### New Concepts 1. Universality of Existential Dread 2.

********************" Last paragraph on pg. 177, 88 of 294, 29.- Heidegger has a similar sentiment as Nietzsche with regards to science, Nietzsche used music as an example- even if science describes a symphony, mathematically, this says nothing about the lived experienced of hearing the music.&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidegger mentions how science, looking at the world theoretically, has 'dimmed it down' and that 'moods', as with music and Nietzsche, still play a role in science; he further makes the point that this does not reduce science to pure 'feeling'.&nbsp;",[[world]] [[death]] [[question]],[[journal314 part vii 47-52]]********************

********************" [46-53 are very important on the 'everydayness' of the evasion of death.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also important on the crucial aspect of anxiety which draws one away from the world, it's preconceived notions of culture, of 'they', and allows one to see one's true self]: a nothingness.&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is a nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, Heidegger asks if this anxiety-ridden existence is even possible, e.g. Nietzsche's breakdown says no, Kierkegaard's 'knight of faith' seems impossible/idealistic, Vivekananda's totally 'selfless' being also seems impossible, Becker agrees that these are not seemingly possible, even thought correct interpretations of the human condition and what is needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anxiety opens discloses the Nothingness of all possibilities of everydayness and turns existence into an impossibility, i.e. Nihilism.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do we go from here?",[[Infranodus_not_in_grap]],[[journal314 part vii 47-52]]********************
