### Thematic Action on Existential Dread

#### **Quotes Extracted on Existential Dread**

1. **Leo Tolstoy**
   - "The truth lay in this that life had no meaning for me. Every day of life, every step in it, brought me nearer the edge of a precipice, whence I saw clearly the final ruin before me. To stop, to go back, were alike impossible; nor could I shut my eyes so as not to see the suffering that alone awaited me, the death of all in me, even to annihilation." [Leo Tolstoy, page 22](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=22)
   - "I hid away a cord, to avoid being tempted to hang myself by it to one of the pegs between the cupboards of my study, where I undressed alone every evening, and ceased carrying a gun because it offered too easy a way of getting rid of life. I knew not what I wanted; I was afraid of life; I shrank from it, and yet there was something I hoped far from it." [Leo Tolstoy, page 22](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=22)
   - "To accept life as described by Solomon and Schopenhauer, to know that it is a stupid and ridiculous joke, and yet live on, to wash, dress, dine, talk, and even write books. This position was painful and disgusting to me, but I remained in it." [Leo Tolstoy, page 24](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=24)
   - "It might seem frightful to anyone who does not realize the nothingness and absurdity of an isolated personal life, and who believes that he will never die. But I know that my life, considered in relation to my individual happiness, is, taken by itself, a stupendous farce, and that this meaningless existence will end in a stupid death. Knowing this, I have nothing to fear." [Leo Tolstoy, pages 20-21](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=20)
   - "It is no fable, but a living, undeniable truth, to be understood of all men. The former delusion of happiness in life which hid from me the horror of the dragon no longer deceives me." [Leo Tolstoy, page 23](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=23)
   - "All those who had searched like myself had failed also, and come like me to the despairing conviction that the only absolute knowledge man can possess is this that life is without a meaning." [Leo Tolstoy, page 23](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=23)
   - "We approach truth only in the proportion as we are farther from life," says Socrates, when preparing to die. What do we who love truth seek in life? In order to be free from the body and all the ills that accompany life in it. If so, then, how shall we not be glad of the approach of death? A wise man seeks death all his life, and death has no terrors for him...The only thing that remains to us is nothing." [Leo Tolstoy, pages 24-25](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=24)
   - "Life is what it ought not to be; 'an evil, and a passage from it into nothingness is the only good in life,' says Schopenhauer. Everything in the world, both folly and wisdom, both riches and poverty, rejoicing and grief, all is vanity and worthless. Man dies and nothing is left of him, and this again is vanity, says Solomon." [Leo Tolstoy, page 24](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=24)

2. **Fr. Seraphim Rose**
   - "The whole world, it almost seems, is divided into those who lead meaningless, futile lives without being aware of it, and those who, being aware of it, are driven to madness and suicide." [Fr. Seraphim Rose, page 51](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=51)
   - "If God is dead, if there is no immortality - then this world is all there is, and this world is absurd, this world is Hell." [Fr. Seraphim Rose, page 51](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=51)
   - "Such is the Nihilist universe, in which there is neither up nor down, right nor wrong, true nor false, because there is no longer any point of orientation. Where there was once God, there is now nothing..." [Fr. Seraphim Rose, page 51](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=51)
   - "In the Nihilist 'new earth' all human energy is to be devoted to worldly concerns; the whole human environment and every object in it are to serve the cause of 'production' and to remind men that their only happiness lies in this world; there is to be established, in fact, the absolute despotism of worldliness." [Fr. Seraphim Rose, page 57](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=57)
   - "In such phenomena 'activity' is clearly an escape--an escape from boredom, from meaninglessness, and most profoundly from the emptiness that takes possession of the heart that has abandoned God." [Fr. Seraphim Rose, page 56](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=56)

3. **St. Augustine**
   - "For I wondered that others, subject to death, did live, since he whom I loved, as if he should never die, was dead. and I wondered yet more that myself, who was to him a second self, could live, he being dead. Well said one of his friend, 'Thou half of my soul'; for I felt that my soul and his soul were 'one soul in two bodies': and therefore was my life a horror to me, because I would not live halved." [St. Augustine, page 4](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=4)

4. **Miguel de Molinos**
   - "The way to attain that high state of a Mind reformed, whereby a man immediately gets to the greatest Good, to our first Original, and to the highest Peace, is his Nothingness: Endeavour, O Soul, to be always buried in that Nothingness." [Miguel de Molinos, page 9](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=9)

5. **G.K. Chesterton**
   - "Everything that we do to make our existence secure is like the act of the ostrich, when she hides her head in the sand, and does not see that her destruction is near. But we are even more foolish than the ostrich." [G.K. Chesterton, page 31](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=31)
   - "Now it is the charge against the main deductions of the materialist that, right or wrong, they gradually destroy his humanity; I do not mean only kindness, I mean hope, courage, poetry, initiative, all that is human. For instance, when materialism leads men to complete fatalism (as it generally does), it is quite idle to pretend that it is in any sense a liberating force." [G.K. Chesterton, page 35](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=35)
   - "The earth is so very large, and the cosmos is so very small. The cosmos is about the smallest hole that a man can hide his head in." [G.K. Chesterton, page 35](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=35)
   - "The chief mark and element of insanity; we may say in summary that it is reason used without root, reason in the void." [G.K. Chesterton, page 35

6. **St. John of the Cross**
   - "The doctrine of Jesus, which teaches us that we cannot possibly make life secure, but that we must be ready to die at any moment, is unquestionably preferable to the doctrine of the world, which obliges us to struggle for the security of existence." [St. John of the Cross, page 31](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=31)
   - "The whole creation (all wisdom, sweetness, goodness, liberty, riches, etc.), compared with the infinite Being of God, is nothing; and so the soul whose chief mark and element of insanity; we may say in summary that it is reason used without root, reason in the void." [St. John of the Cross, page 38](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=38)

#### **Analysis**

The quotes reveal a profound and multifaceted engagement with the theme of existential dread and the inherent anxiety associated with human existence, especially when contemplating the vastness and absurdity of life. This theme is essential in understanding Nihiltheism as it bridges the gap between nihilistic despair and the potential for spiritual awakening through the acceptance of nothingness.

1. **Leo Tolstoy**:
   - Emphasizes the absurdity and meaninglessness of life, reinforcing his view that life, in its isolation, is a farce that ends in a meaningless death. Tolstoy’s reflections illustrate the deep existential dread that accompanies the realization of life’s inherent absurdity.
   - His references to Socrates and Schopenhauer underscore the philosophical tradition of viewing life as an evil to be escaped through death, which aligns with the core tenets of Nihiltheism.

2. **Fr. Seraphim Rose**:
   - Highlights how activities are often an escape from the underlying emptiness that pervades a life devoid of God. This perspective aligns with the Nihiltheistic view that worldly pursuits are ultimately futile in providing true meaning or fulfillment.

3. **St. Augustine**:
   - Reflects on the horror of living after the death of a loved one, experiencing a life that feels incomplete and dreadful. This personal account of existential dread resonates with the Nihiltheistic emphasis on the inherent suffering of human existence.

4. **Miguel de Molinos**:
   - Advocates for embracing nothingness as a pathway to achieving the highest state of mind and peace. This aligns with the mystical aspect of Nihiltheism, where the acceptance of existential dread leads to spiritual enlightenment.

5. **G.K. Chesterton**:
   - Critiques materialism for its tendency to strip away humanity's hope, courage, and other human qualities, leading to a fatalistic and nihilistic outlook. His reflections on the smallness of the cosmos and the void of reason further underscore the sense of existential dread.
   
6. **St. John of the Cross**:
   - Emphasizes the nothingness of the world in comparison to the infinite being of God, illustrating the profound existential dread and spiritual longing that characterize the Nihiltheistic experience. His reflections on the void and the darkness of the world align with the theme of existential dread.

### Conclusion

### Step 1.1: Existential Dread

**Question**: How do the quotes reflect on the inherent anxiety or fear associated with human existence, especially in the context of contemplating the vastness or absurdity of life?

**Analysis**:

1. **Fear of Life and Death**:
   - "It is one thing to ritually wash one’s hands three times; it is another to wash them until the hands bleed and one is in the bathroom most of the day. Here we see in pure culture, as it were, what is at stake in all human repression: the fear of life and death. Safety in the face of the real terror of creature existence is becoming a real problem for the person. He feels vulnerable—which is the truth!" [Unknown Author, page 65-66](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=65).
   - "Man emerged from the instinctive thoughtless action of the lower animals and came to reflect on his condition. He was given a consciousness of his individuality and his part-divinity in creation, the beauty and uniqueness of his face and his name. At the same time he was given the consciousness of the terror of the world and of his own death and decay. The final terror of self-consciousness is the knowledge of one’s own death, which is the peculiar sentence on man alone in the animal kingdom." [Unknown Author, page 48-47](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=48).

2. **Nihilism and Overwhelmingness of Existence**:
   - "Living in the world of men an impossibility. It places a trembling animal at the mercy of the entire cosmos and the problem of the meaning of it. The tragedy of life that Searles is referring to is the one we have been discussing: man's finitude, his dread of death and of the overwhelmingness of life. The schizophrenic feels these more than anyone else because he has not been able to build the confident defenses that a person normally uses to deny them." [Unknown Author, page 45-46](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=45).
   - "It can’t be overstressed, one final time, that to see the world as it really is is devastating and terrifying. It makes thoughtless living in the world of men an impossibility. It places a trembling animal at the mercy of the entire cosmos and the problem of the meaning of it." [Unknown Author, page 44-45](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=44).

3. **Madness and Isolation**:
   - "Everything that man does in his symbolic world is an attempt to deny and overcome his grotesque fate. He literally drives himself into a blind obliviousness with social games, psychological tricks, personal preoccupations so far removed from the reality of his situation that they are forms of madness—agreed madness, shared madness, disguised and dignified madness, but madness all the same." [Unknown Author, page 38-39](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=38).
   - "Why most people did not become insane in the face of the existential contradiction between a symbolic self that seems to give man infinite worth in a timeless scheme of things, and a body that is worth about 98 cents. How to reconcile the two?" [Unknown Author, page 38-39](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=38).

4. **Depression and Guilt**:
   - "When the average person can no longer convincingly perform his safe heroics or cannot hide his failure to be his own hero, then he bogs down in the failure of depression and its terrible guilt. Boss says that the terrible guilt feelings of the depressed person are existential, that is, they represent the failure to live one’s own life, to fulfill one’s own potential because of the twisting and turning to be “good” in the eyes of the other. The other calls the tune to one’s eligibility for immortality, and so." [Unknown Author, page 88-89](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=88).
   - "He knows Truth and Reality, the motives of the entire universe. It was G. K. Chesterton who kept alive the spirit of Kierkegaard and naive Christianity in modern thought, as when he showed with such style that the characteristics the modern mind prides itself on are precisely those of madness." [Unknown Author, page 85-86](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=85).

5. **Therapeutic Illusions and Existential Terror**:
   - "Not everyone is as honest as Freud was when he said that he cured the miseries of the neurotic only to open him up to the normal misery of life." [Unknown Author, page 101-102](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=101).
   - "When the average person can no longer convincingly perform his safe heroics or cannot hide his failure to be his own hero, then he bogs down in the failure of depression and its terrible guilt." [Unknown Author, page 88-89](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=88).

**Summary**:

The text delves deeply into the theme of existential dread, presenting it as an intrinsic part of human existence. The fear of life and death is described as a fundamental anxiety that arises from self-consciousness and the awareness of mortality. This dread is unique to humans and is highlighted through various examples, such as the obsessive-compulsive behaviors driven by fear of life and death, and the existential analysis of the Garden of Eden myth which underscores human awareness of death and decay.

Nihilism and the overwhelming nature of existence are depicted as terrifying and paralyzing, making it difficult for individuals to navigate life without confronting the stark reality of their mortality. This is particularly pronounced in individuals who cannot build psychological defenses, such as schizophrenics, who are unable to shield themselves from these existential fears.

Madness and isolation are recurrent themes, with the text suggesting that human attempts to create meaning and overcome their fate often result in a shared, dignified madness. The symbolic self that humans create to give their lives infinite worth is in stark contrast to the finite, fragile human body, creating an existential contradiction that many struggle to reconcile.

Depression and guilt are shown as consequences of failing to live up to societal expectations of heroism and immortality. The text describes how average individuals, when unable to meet these expectations, succumb to depression and existential guilt, driven by their failure to live authentically.

Finally, therapeutic illusions and the inherent terror of existence are addressed, with the text critiquing the superficial solutions offered by psychology and therapy. These practices often fail to address the deeper existential terror and absurdity of life, leaving individuals to grapple with the stark reality of their existence.

The overarching insight is that existential dread is a pervasive and unavoidable aspect of human existence, deeply intertwined with the awareness of mortality and the struggle to create meaningful lives amidst an indifferent universe. This aligns with the broader context of Nihiltheism, which embraces the acceptance of this dread as a pathway to deeper spiritual understanding.

Analysis: This quote illustrates how human actions, even seemingly simple ones like hand-washing, can become extreme manifestations of the underlying fear of life and death. The "real terror of creature existence" underscores the existential dread that is a fundamental part of human consciousness, making individuals feel profoundly vulnerable.
Quote: "...the best existential analysis of the human condition leads directly into the problems of God and faith... (on the Myth/Fall of Adam and Eve) Man emerged from the instinctive thoughtless action of the lower animals and came to reflect on his condition. He was given a consciousness of his individuality and his part-divinity in creation, the beauty and uniqueness of his face and his name. At the same time he was given the consciousness of the terror of the world and of his own death and decay... the final terror of self-consciousness is the knowledge of one’s own death, which is the peculiar sentence on man alone in the animal kingdom. This is the meaning of the Garden of Eden myth and the rediscovery of modern psychology: that death is man’s peculiar and greatest anxiety." Journal314_4, pages 48-49.
Analysis: This quote connects existential dread with the myth of Adam and Eve, highlighting the consciousness of death as a unique human trait. This awareness creates a profound existential anxiety, illustrating how the reflection on one’s condition leads to a deeper understanding of life's inherent dread.
Quote: "It can’t be overstressed, one final time, that to see the world as it really is is devastating and terrifying... It makes thoughtless living in the world of men an impossibility.

Quote: "Rank understood that in the face of the overwhelmingness of the world the child could not out of himself muster the stamina and the authority necessary to live in full expansiveness with limitless horizons of perception and experience... The tragedy of life that Searles is referring to is the one we have been discussing: man's finitude, his dread of death and of the overwhelmingness of life. The schizophrenic feels these more than anyone else because he has not been able to build the confident defenses that a person normally uses to deny them." Journal314_4, pages 45-46.
Analysis: This quote delves into the psychological aspect of existential dread, noting how some individuals, particularly those with schizophrenia, feel the overwhelming nature of life and the fear of death more acutely.

One could call it existential doubt, in contrast to the methodological and the skeptical doubt. It does not question whether a special proposition is true or false. It does not reject every concrete truth, but it is aware of the element of insecurity in every existential truth." Journal314_4, pages 116-117.
