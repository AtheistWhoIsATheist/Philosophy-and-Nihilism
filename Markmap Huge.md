# Nihilism: Expanded Framework
- **Traditional Nihilism**
  - **Absence of Intrinsic Meaning, Value, and Purpose**
    - Traditional Nihilism posits that life lacks inherent meaning, value, or purpose. This perspective challenges the foundational beliefs that underpin many philosophical, religious, and ethical systems, asserting that human existence is insignificant in the grand scheme of the universe.
    - **Existential Nihilism**
      - **Core Belief:**
        - Life has no inherent meaning or value.
      - **Implications:**
        - Individuals are free to create their own meaning and moral frameworks.
        - Acknowledges an existential void, where objective truths or values do not exist.
      - **Personal Interpretations:**
        - While rejecting intrinsic meaning, existential nihilism allows for personal spirituality and morality.
        - Encourages authenticity and personal responsibility in crafting one's life purpose.
      - **Examples:**
        - Choosing personal goals despite acknowledging their lack of universal significance.
