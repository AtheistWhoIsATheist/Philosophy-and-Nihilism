Why do humans dismiss subjectivity in the most important aspects of their lives, e.g. values, meaning, purpose. And yet, they bolster it right on up as soon as it comes to the threat of Nihilism? Fear? Uncertainty? Abject tenor? Ha! The answer likely lies in the human psychology itself. Fear and inherent cognitive biases jump again, and again into the subconscious carriage when one dips their toes into the perceived ambiguities associated with philosophical thought, intensified exponentially when laced with nihilism. In contrast, subjectivity-something deeply personal and subjective has its pull and comfort. Regardless, it's high time we embrace and account for the impact of these erratic contradictions. Reflecting on how such dynamics navigate and influence our lives is certainly a necessity in pushing the boundaries of understanding human nature and philosophical ideologies.

How ‘meaningful’ could human existence be, when the most fundamental aspects of our existence are either voluntarily or biologically reduced or eliminated in such a way as to become irrelevant? “Values? No, don’t criticize someone’s personal values…well, hang on, they believe what?! Oh, they are a shit person (value judgement).”
