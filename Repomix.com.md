### Commands for Using Repomix


### Step-by-Step Guide to Navigate to Your Repository Folder:
- Here's how you can navigate to your repository folder so you can use the necessary commands:

1. **Open Command Prompt**:
   - Press `Win + R` on your keyboard.
   - Type `cmd` and press Enter. This will open the Command Prompt.

2. **Change Directory to Your Local Repository**:
   - Use the `cd` command followed by the path to your local repository folder. For example, if your repository is located in `C:\Users\adamm\{name of repository}, use the following command:
     ```bash
     cd C:\Users\adamm\Philosophy-and-Nihilism
     ```

3. **Verify You Are in the Correct Directory**:
   - You can check the current directory by running:
     ```bash
     dir
     ```
   - This command will list all files and folders in the current directory, helping you confirm you are in the right place.

### Example Workflow:
```bash
cd C:\Users\adamm\Philosophy-and-Nihilism
dir
```

Once you're in the correct directory, you can start using the commands listed earlier to manage your repository and use Repomix.
