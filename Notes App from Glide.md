- **Both are good and work**

### **a) My V**

- **Always respond with this prompt when Sam asks if you want placeholders written out:**“Yes, I would love that. Since you've pointed out that the placeholders you generate usually come out as "medium quality", we should pause for a moment.  Let’s take a second, focus in on our priority of developing the highest, expert quality placeholders, ponder why it is that you write medium quality” placeholders, think through step-by-step on how you can make them better, elevating your placeholders from "medium quality" to a "God-Level Tier of Unsurpassed Excellence.  By going through each placeholder, step-by-step, ensuring that they are perfectly clear, robustly detailed, and wholly and directly relevant to the prompt, you will fully optimize the placeholders to produce the zenith of outputs, possibly reframing the best practices of prompt engineering due to your innovative and profoundly efficient content creation.”

### b) Write For Me GPT (OpenAI)

- “Yes, I would love that. Since you've noted that the placeholders you generate usually come out as 'medium quality,' let's take a step back for a second, address this issue, and ensure we develop placeholders of the highest, expert quality. By carefully reviewing each placeholder step-by-step to make sure they are clear, detailed, and directly relevant to the prompt, we can elevate them to a 'God-Level Tier of Unsurpassed Excellence.' This focused approach will optimize the placeholders for the best possible outputs.”

\## Task Description  
  
\- \*\*YOUR TASK\*\* is to \*\*CREATE\*\* a step-by-step guide to build a notes taking app using Glide. The instructions should be clear, jargon-free, and easy for a complete beginner to follow.  
  
(Context: "This guide will enable anyone, regardless of their technical background, to create a functional notes taking app.")  
  
\## Core Features & Functionality  
  
1\. \*\*Folders/Categories\*\*  
   - \*\*CREATE\*\* a home screen with clearly labeled folders for organizing notes.  
   - \*\*ALLOW\*\* for sub-folders within folders to create a hierarchy for more complex organization.

Sure! I will guide you through each step to build the notes-taking app using Glide. If you encounter any issues or need further explanations along the way, feel free to ask.  
  
\## Step 1: Setting Up Glide  
  
1\. \*\*Sign Up:\*\*  
   - Go to \[Glide\]([https://www.glideapps.com/)](https://www.glideapps.com/\)) and sign up for an account if you haven't already.  
  
2\. \*\*Create New Project:\*\*  
   - Click on "New project."  
   - Select "Google Sheets" as your data source.  
  
3\. \*\*Name Your Project:\*\*  
   - Name your project, e.g., "Notes App."  
   - Choose a Google Sheet to connect to your app. If you don't have one yet, you can create it in the next steps.  
  
\## Step 2: Setting Up Google Sheets  
  
1\. \*\*Create a Google Sheet:\*\*  
   - Open Google Sheets and create a new spreadsheet. Name it "Notes App."  
  
2\. \*\*Create Sheets:\*\*  
   - Add two sheets within the spreadsheet: "Folders" and "Notes."  
  
3\. \*\*Setup Folders Sheet:\*\*  
   - In the "Folders" sheet, add columns:  
     - A1: "Folder ID"  
     - B1: "Folder Name"  
  
4\. \*\*Setup Notes Sheet:\*\*  
   - In the "Notes" sheet, add columns:  
     - A1: "Note ID"  
     - B1: "Title"  
     - C1: "Content"  
     - D1: "Creation Date"  
     - E1: "Folder ID"  
  
Here's a simple example:  
  
\*\*Folders Sheet:\*\*  
| Folder ID | Folder Name |  
|-----------|-------------|  
| 1         | Work        |  
| 2         | Personal    |  
  
\*\*Notes Sheet:\*\*  
| Note ID | Title     | Content              | Creation Date | Folder ID |  
|---------|-----------|----------------------|---------------|-----------|  
| 1       | Meeting   | Discuss project plan | 2024-06-25    | 1         |  
| 2       | Shopping  | Buy groceries        | 2024-06-24    | 2         |  
  
\## Step 3: Configuring Glide Data Source  
  
1\. \*\*Connect to Google Sheets:\*\*  
   - In your Glide project, connect to the Google Sheets file you created.  
  
2\. \*\*Set Up Data:\*\*  
   - Ensure Glide correctly imports the "Folders" and "Notes" sheets by checking the Data section in Glide.  
  
\## Step 4: Creating Folders/Categories  
  
1\. \*\*Add Home Tab:\*\*  
   - In Glide, click on the "Tabs" section and add a new tab named "Home."  
   - Link this tab to the "Folders" sheet.  
  
2\. \*\*Create Folders Layout:\*\*  
   - Choose a list layout to display folders.  
   - Configure the list to show folder names and link to a detailed view of each folder, which will display related notes.  
  
\## Step 5: Adding Notes  
  
1\. \*\*Create Notes Tab:\*\*  
   - Add another tab in Glide named "Notes."  
   - Link this tab to the "Notes" sheet.  
  
2\. \*\*Enable Rich Text Formatting:\*\*  
   - In the "Notes" tab, enable rich text formatting for the "Content" field to allow for formatted notes.  
  
3\. \*\*Link Notes to Folders:\*\*  
   - In the "Notes" tab, add a relation column to link notes to their respective folders using the "Folder ID."  
  
\## Step 6: Implementing Search  
  
1\. \*\*Add Search Bar:\*\*  
   - In the "Notes" tab, add a search bar component.  
   - Configure the search bar to search within "Title" and "Content" columns.  
  
\## Step 7: Sorting and Filtering Notes  
  
1\. \*\*Add Sorting Options:\*\*  
   - In the "Notes" tab, add sorting options to sort by "Creation Date" (newest to oldest, oldest to newest) or "Title" (A-Z, Z-A).  
  
2\. \*\*Add Filtering Options:\*\*  
   - Add filters to display notes based on the selected folder. Use a choice component to filter notes by their folder.  
  
\## Step 8: Note Editing and Deletion  
  
1\. \*\*Enable Note Editing:\*\*  
   - In the "Notes" tab, enable editing options for each note by setting the details screen to be editable.  
  
2\. \*\*Add Note Button:\*\*  
   - Add a button labeled "Add New Note" that opens a form to create a new note.  
   - Ensure the form includes fields for the note's title, content, creation date, and folder ID.  
  
3\. \*\*Add Delete Button:\*\*  
   - Add a delete button for each note with a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental deletions.  
  
\## Step 9: Adding Additional Features  
  
1\. \*\*Sharing Notes:\*\*  
   - Add a share button that generates a link to the note or allows sharing via email.  
  
2\. \*\*Reminders/Notifications:\*\*  
   - Add fields for setting reminders and configure notifications if Glide supports it.  
  
3\. \*\*Tags:\*\*  
   - Add a "Tags" column in the "Notes" sheet for additional organization. Allow multiple tags per note and configure Glide to handle tags appropriately.  
  
\## Step 10: Designing the Interface  
  
1\. \*\*Home Screen Layout:\*\*  
   - Display folders in a list or tile format. When a folder is clicked, it shows a list of notes within that folder, displaying the note's title and a brief description.  
  
2\. \*\*Note Display:\*\*  
   - Implement a preview mode: Clicking a note shows a summary. Clicking again opens the full note for editing.  
  
3\. \*\*Dark Mode:\*\*  
   - Enable dark mode by going to the app settings and turning on dark mode.
