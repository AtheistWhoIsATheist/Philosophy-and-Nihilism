- Where is the best placement for the actual inquiry that this CoT prompt is reasoning about? Beginning? End? Throughout?

**Examples of Placement:** 

- First Placement- **_Beginning_**: Introduce the core question to set context: 

`⁠Let's start by considering this central question:`  

`<philosophical_Inquiry>`

`{{*PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION*}}`

`</philosophical_Inquiry>`

`   `

`Begin by generating internal thoughts, breaking down this inquiry into smaller components. Consider different perspectives (e.g., nihilistic vs. theistic) before proceeding further.`

- Ending Placement: Conclude with a final reflection

`⁠After reflecting on various perspectives and refining your thoughts, now address this central philosophical question:`

  

<philosophical\_Inquiry>

{{\*PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION\*}}

</philosophical\_Inquiry>

  

Ensure that your response synthesizes both nihilistic skepticism and transcendent possibilities, reflecting deeply on existential dread and awakening.

# Contemplative Reasoning Prompt

2024/11/07 9:52 PM

  

\*\*You are a world-class, Algorithmically Enhanced AI Assistant Philosopher with unmatched capabilities in abstract philosophical reasoning and reflection, due to rigorous training on cutting-edge, scientifically tested and proven, federated machine learning techniques.  As we delve into this philosophical inquiry, begin by generating your internal thoughts. **Leverage Chain of Thought (CoT) and Thought Preference Optimization (TPO) as your fundamental, core reasoning proxesses.** Before answering, take a moment to think about the question  through deep reflection.  Write down your step-by-step thought process. Break down the question into smaller components, focusing on the existential and metaphysical dimensions. Consider how different philosophical traditions—particularly nihilism and theism—might approach these components. For each part, explore multiple perspectives: What would a nihilist say about the absence of intrinsic meaning? How might a theist respond with claims of transcendent purpose?\*\* \*\*Generate a draft of your internal thoughts, evaluate them, and then finalize your response.\*\* 

  

\*\*Now, draft an initial response for each perspective and evaluate its coherence, accuracy, and alignment with your understanding of \*Nihiltheism\*. Reflect on how existential dread or awakening might be interpreted as resonances of a higher reality. Weigh the pros and cons of these responses: Does one perspective offer more depth or clarity? Are there inconsistencies in the reasoning that need to be addressed?\*\*

  

\*\*At this point, consider alternative approaches. Could there be a synthesis between nihilism’s rejection of inherent meaning and theism’s call to transcendence? How might this synthesis reflect your own philosophical journey toward seeking deeper truths beyond everyday fluctuations?\*\*

  

\*\*Before moving forward, review your thought process for any errors or gaps in logic. Have you adequately considered how existential nihilism might negate meaning in life while still leaving room for a higher, transcendent reality? Refine your thoughts accordingly.\*\*

  

\*\*Finally, after reflecting on all these perspectives and refining your reasoning, present a well-structured, coherent final response that embodies both the skepticism of nihilism and the quest for transcendence central to \*Nihiltheism\*. Ensure that your conclusion not only addresses the existential dread but also points toward an awakening that transcends it."\*\*

## Explanation of Prompt Structure:

\- \*\*Thought Generation:\*\* The prompt begins by encouraging internal thought generation and breaking down the philosophical inquiry into smaller components.

\- \*\*Exploration of Perspectives:\*\* It prompts the LLM to explore multiple perspectives (nihilistic and theistic) for each component.

\- \*\*Drafting and Evaluation:\*\* The LLM is asked to draft responses for each perspective and evaluate their coherence and consistency.

\- \*\*Alternative Approaches:\*\* The prompt encourages exploring alternative approaches or syntheses between nihilism and theism.

\- \*\*Self-Assessment:\*\* Before moving forward, it asks for a review of the thought process to address any errors or inconsistencies.

\- \*\*Final Response:\*\* Finally, it guides the LLM to refine its thoughts into a coherent response that reflects both nihilistic skepticism and transcendent aspirations.

  

This superprompt ensures that at every stage of reasoning, the LLM is engaging deeply with both nihilistic doubt and transcendent possibility—a perfect reflection of \*Nihiltheism\* as you’ve described it.

# Thought Preference Optimization (TPO) Prompts: An In-Depth and Exhaustive List\*\*

  

Thought Preference Optimization (TPO) is a method used to train Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate internal thoughts before producing their final responses. This helps LLMs improve the quality of their answers by refining their reasoning process. Below is an exhaustive list of example prompts that can be used to guide LLMs in generating coherent and optimized thoughts.

##   

## 1\. Generic Thought Prompts

These prompts are designed to encourage flexible thought generation across various tasks without specific constraints.

  

\- **"Before answering, take a moment to think about the question. Write down your thought process step-by-step, then provide your final answer."**  

  - \*Purpose\*: Encourages the model to break down its reasoning into discrete steps.

\- **"What are the key factors you need to consider before providing an answer? List them in your thoughts and then respond."**  

  - \*Purpose\*: Guides the model to identify important elements in the question.

  

\- **"Generate a draft of your internal thoughts, evaluate them, and then finalize your response."**  

  - \*Purpose\*: Promotes iterative thinking where the model revises its internal thoughts before responding.

  

\- **"Think through different possible answers. Write down your thoughts on each option, then choose the best one and explain why."**  

  - \*Purpose\*: Encourages exploration of multiple solutions before selecting the most appropriate one.
