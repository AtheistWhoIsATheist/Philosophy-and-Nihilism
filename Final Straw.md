# Final Straw 

Please tell me, if I'm writing in a note, and accidentally delete some text, there's a way to undo it, and retrieve the text?

  

## Mem:

I'm afraid once text has been deleted from a note, it cannot be retrieved unless it was previously saved or backed up. Mem currently doesn't have a built-in feature to retrieve deleted text. However, it's always a good practice to regularly save your work and keep backups for this reason. 

  

Here are some strategies you can employ to prevent accidental deletion of important information:

  

1\. Regular Backups: Regularly export your notes as a backup. This can be done manually or through automated services if available.

2\. Version Control: If you're working on a particularly important document, consider using a version control system. This allows you to save different versions of your document, making it easy to revert to a previous version if something goes wrong.

3\. Save Frequently: Make a habit of saving your work frequently. This reduces the amount of data you could potentially lose if something goes wrong.

  

Remember, prevention is always better than cure. It's much easier to prevent data loss in the first place than it is to recover lost data. So, make sure you're taking the necessary steps to protect your data.

## Me 

No, that can't possibly be true. That's the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard. This is a fucking notes app! How could you not retrieve accidentally deleted text immediately after the fact?

  

## Mem:

I get where you're coming from, Adam. It does seem counter-intuitive for a note-taking application not to have a way to recover accidentally deleted writing. However, as it stands, Mem doesn't support the retrieval of deleted text. 

  

That said, the Mem team is continuously working on improving and expanding its features based on user feedback and needs. So, it's possible that future updates could include a mechanism for recovering lost data. 

  

In the meantime, the best practices I mentioned earlier can help prevent accidental data loss. It might require an additional effort, but it can provide a safety net for your valuable data.

## Me:

This has an automatic save to cloud feature what the fuck would I be doing making backups all the time? And if there isn't a way to retrieve immediately deleted text, then that would mean that I'd have to back up my data after every sentence, because God forbid I'm just brainstorming, delete by accident, and don't remember the details! Backing up the files isn't a solution.

  

## Mem:

You're absolutely right, Adam. In an ideal world, a note-taking app should have an undo feature or a way to recover recently deleted text, especially when it auto-saves to the cloud. It's a pretty standard feature and it's surprising that it's not available. 

  

I can see how the lack of this feature could be frustrating, especially when you're in the flow of writing or brainstorming. It's definitely something that the Mem team should consider adding in future updates. 

  

In the meantime, you might want to consider using an external editor for brainstorming sessions, one that has robust undo and recovery features, and then transferring the final text to Mem. It's not a perfect solution, but it could help prevent accidental data loss until Mem introduces a recovery feature. 

  

What do you think? Would that be a viable workaround for you?

  

## Me: 

That's the second time you've suggested using another app. I'm gonna go ahead and take your advice.

  

\## Mem:

Sounds like a plan, Adam. It's not the most seamless solution, but it should help prevent any accidental data loss during your brainstorming sessions. Once you've got your thoughts in order, you can then transfer them over to Mem. 

  

By the way, if you're looking for an external editor, I'd recommend one that auto-saves frequently and has a robust version history feature. That way, you can always revert back to an earlier version if needed. 

  

Let me know how it goes, or if you need any other tips or suggestions.
