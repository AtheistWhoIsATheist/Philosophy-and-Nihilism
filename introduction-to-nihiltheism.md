# Introduction to Nihiltheism

 Nihiltheism exemplifies the correlation between Nihilism and the Transcendent. Rather than perceiving Nihilism as a vacuum devoid of values, morality, or purpose, it positions itself as an earthly impression of the Transcendent. This viewpoint compels us to question the baseline assumptions about our life purposes, values, beliefs, and the rather ephemeral concepts of reality. Nihiltheism argues that after the full grasp of existential meaninglessness reduces the entirety of existence into Nothing, one must consciously engage with it.

Nihilism, being the all encompassing destroyer of worlds, brings one to the deepest depths of anguish and despair, pushing the Nihiltheist to explore possible existential frameworks that may lay beyond the limitations of naturalistic perspectives.&nbsp;Nihilism, once encountered, must now be continuously confronted.

As it is that one can never escape the unyielding grasp of the after effects of such a traumatic experience, as a biological being, there is the constant pulling down into the world, that is almost equally as powerful. This is where one gets lost in the illusory nature of existence, within the finite, and allows themselves to take this transitory state of being which is perceived as utterly meaningless, as something meaningful.

Bymaintaining a focus on the finite, one loses grasp on the already fleeting nature of an Infinite reality, or the possibility of such. Therefore one must sit within the Nothingness of the world, as a constant reminder to continuously pull oneself out of the meaningless by means of despairing.

There is no _simple salvation_.

As the attempt to dwell in this state of being is literally impossible to do for any indefinite amount of time, and any human attempt — religious, philosophical, or otherwise — to counteract or bypass Nihilism will only further extend the infinite gulf that lay between the human condition and the Transcendent, one is left with a question: What does one do? 

Pushed by an earthly echo of what may be beyond the constructs natural descriptions , one attempts to access a fleeting glimpse of the Transcendent through structured processes involving hallucinogenic medicines and guided contemplative enquiry. A full dedication is needed which results in the encounter of the Transcendent Other as both terrifyingly foreign and unattainably familiar. 

Interestingly, retracing back to corporeal reality from this unimaginable form of experience with the Transcendent, doesn't resolve existential torments but instead refuels them, as the objectivity of this subjective experience is snatched back by the irresolvable doubt that permeates the human experience.

Nihilism then emerges as an essential part of our spiritual journey, freeing us from our orbiting certainty and propelling us towards a direct awakening of the unknown. Within the context of Nihiltheism, battling existential contradictions and glaring realities inspire a penetrating clarity of the Nothingness, that is either guiding one towards Divine illumination or showcasing, with yet another story of illusions, the still omnipotence of the experience of Nihilism.
