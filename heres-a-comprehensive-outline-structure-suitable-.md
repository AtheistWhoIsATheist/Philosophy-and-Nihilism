    ---
    
    ### **I. Preliminary Pages**  
    **A. Title Page**

    - **Advisor** : [Advisor’s Name, Title]  
    
    **B. Abstract**  
    - **Research Problem** : Existential awakenings (ecstasy/dread) are reductively framed as psychological states, neglecting their epistemic potential as traces of Transcendence.  
    - **Methodology** : Hermeneutic phenomenology analyzing primary texts (Heidegger, Cioran, Tillich, Vivekananda), comparative non-Western frameworks (Advaita Vedanta, Zen), and autoethnographic reflection.  
    - **Findings** : Nihilism and theism converge apophatically; existential extremes signal a Transcendent Reality beyond being/nonbeing.  
    - **Conclusions** : Nihiltheism (NT) resolves nihilism-theism antagonism, reorienting existential crises as spiritual initiation.  
    - **Keywords** : Nihiltheism, apophasis, transcendence, existential resonance, nonduality.  
    
    **C. Acknowledgements**  
    - Mentors: Advisor, committee members.

    ---
    
    ### **II. Introduction**  
    **A. Overview**  
    - **Hook** : *"What if the silence after Nietzsche’s ‘God is dead’ is not emptiness but the hum of Transcendence?"*  
    - **Context** : Post-secular philosophy struggles to redefine meaning after nihilism; NT bridges existential phenomenology and mystical apophasis.  
    
    **B. Problem Statement**  
    - **Gap** : Liminal experiences (dread/awe) are dismissed as ephemera, not hermeneutic tools for Transcendence.  
    - **Consequence** : Perpetuates false nihilism-theism dichotomy, stifling post-metaphysical spirituality.  
    
    **C. Purpose Statement**  
    - **Aim** : Systematize NT as a framework where existential extremes (e.g., Heidegger’s *Angst*, Cioran’s despair) unveil Transcendent Reality.  
    
    **D. Research Questions**  
    1. How do existential resonances destabilize the subject-object divide, opening epistemic access to Transcendence?  
    2. What is the ontological status of "nothingness" in NT, and how does it relate to theological ultimates (Tillich’s "Ground of Being")?  
    3. Can NT resolve nihilism’s *quietism* by reframing apathy as apophatic receptivity?  
    
    **E. Significance**  
    - **Theoretical** : Synthesizes continental philosophy (Heidegger), radical nihilism (Cioran), and mystical theology (Tillich, Vivekananda).  
    - **Practical** : Offers mental health frameworks to reinterpret existential crises as transformative.  
    
    **F. Scope and Delimitations**  
    - **Focus** : 20th-century Western existentialists and non-Western nondualists; excludes postmodern relativism.  
    - **Delimitation** : Autoethnographic data limited to author’s lived NT experience.  
    
    **G. Key Terms**  
    - **Existential Resonance** : Affect-laden moments (e.g., dread, awe) that disrupt ordinary consciousness.  
    - **Apophatic Synthesis** : Transcendence known via negation (e.g., "neti neti," Heidegger’s *Nichts*).  
    
    **H. Organization**  
    - Chapters: (1) NT’s philosophical foundations, (2) Comparative analysis, (3) Implications for meaning-creation.  
    
    ---
    
    ### **III. Literature Review**  
    **A. Introduction**  
    - **Selection Criteria** : Prioritize works engaging existential affect (dread/ecstasy) and apophatic theology.  
    
    **B. Theoretical Framework**  
    - Heidegger’s *Angst* as ontic collapse/ontological opening.  
    - Tillich’s "God above God" vs. Cioran’s "There is no other world. Even this one doesn’t exist."  
    
    **C. Review of Research**  
    - **Theme 1** : Nihilism as spiritual catalyst (Cioran’s *The Trouble with Being Born* vs. Nietzsche’s active nihilism).  
    - **Theme 2** : Non-Western apophasis (Vivekananda’s *māyā* as illusory separation; Zen’s *mu*).  
    - **Gap** : No extant synthesis treating nihilism’s "void" as coterminous with theological ultimates.  
    
    **D. Synthesis and Critique**  
    - **Critique** : Theistic responses to nihilism (e.g., Kierkegaard) often defend dogma; NT embraces annihilation as revelatory.  
    
    **E. Conclusion**  
    - NT addresses the lacuna by fusing existential phenomenology with mystical negation.  
    
    ---
    
    ### **IV. Methodology**  
    **A. Introduction**  
    - **Research Questions** : Demand hermeneutic engagement with texts/experience.  
    
    **B. Research Design**  
    - **Design** : Hermeneutic phenomenology (Van Manen) + comparative philosophy.  
    - **Rationale** : Balances rigor with existential immediacy.  
    
    **C. Participants/Subjects**  
    - **Texts** : Heidegger’s *Being and Time*, Cioran’s aphorisms, Tillich’s sermons, Vivekananda’s *Raja Yoga*.  
    - **Sampling** : Purposive selection of passages exemplifying existential resonance.  
    
    **D. Instruments**  
    - **Close Reading Protocol** : Thematic coding for (1) affect, (2) ontological claims, (3) apophatic gestures.  
    - **Autoethnography** : Reflective journaling on NT’s experiential grounding (see Appendix A).  
    
    **E. Procedures**  
    1. Phase 1: Thematic analysis of key texts.  
    2. Phase 2: Comparative mapping (Western/non-Western apophasis).  
    3. Phase 3: Autoethnographic triangulation.  
    
    **F. Data Analysis**  
    - **Qualitative** : Thematic coding via NVivo; codes include "limit-situation," "nondual insight."  
    - **Validation** : Peer debriefing with phenomenology experts; member-checking via NT discussion groups.  
    
    **G. Ethical Considerations**  
    - **IRB** : Exempt (textual/autoethnographic focus).  
    - **Confidentiality** : Anonymize discussion group participants.  
    
    ---
    
    ### **V. Results**  
    **A. Introduction**  
    - **Findings Structure** : Aligned with research questions.  
    
    **B. Presentation of Findings**  
    1. **Existential Resonance** : Dread/ecstasy dissolve subject-object duality (e.g., Heidegger’s *Angst* as "being-toward" Transcendence).  
    2. **Ontological Synthesis** : Cioran’s "All my life I’ve oscillated between God and nothingness" mirrors Tillich’s "God does not exist. He is being-itself beyond essence and existence."  
    3. **Apophatic Ethics** : Vivekananda’s "truth is silence" reorients nihilistic apathy as contemplative rigor.  
    
    ---
    
    ### **VI. Discussion**  
    **A. Interpretation**  
    - NT unmasks nihilism as "theism’s shadow" (both arise from Transcendent encounter).  
    
    **B. Theoretical Implications**  
    - Theology: Rejects anthropomorphism; Transcendence is "void-as-plenum."  
    - Philosophy: Resolves Heidegger’s unasked "meta-ontological" question.  
    
    **C. Practical Implications**  
    - **Mental Health** : Reframe depressive episodes as "dark nights of the soul" (John of the Cross).  
    - **Interfaith Dialogue** : Common ground in apophasis (e.g., Buddhist śūnyatā and Christian mysticism).  
    
    **D. Limitations**  
    - **Method** : Autoethnography risks solipsism; mitigated by textual triangulation.  
    - **Scope** : Limited engagement with analytic philosophy of religion.  
    
    **E. Future Research**  
    - NT’s implications for AI ethics (e.g., meaning in post-human frameworks).  
    
    ---

    ### **VIII. Appendices**  
    - **Appendix A** : Autoethnographic notes on NT’s genesis (e.g., "March 2023: The dread of folding laundry as…").

### IX. Conclusion A. Summary of Findings This dissertation argues that Nihilistic Theology (NT) offers a novel framework for understanding existential crises. It achieves this by integrating Western existentialism, non-Western nondualism, and autoethnographic reflection. NT reveals that the "void" of nihilism is not merely absence, but can function as a paradoxical ground of meaning, akin to the apophatic God of mystical traditions. Key terms like “Existential Resonance”, "Apophatic Synthesis" were operationalized. The research demonstrates specific commonalities.

### B. Summary of Argument The core argument is that what appears as meaninglessness, the "nothingness" championed by thinkers like Cioran, shares a deep structural affinity with the "God beyond God" described by theologians such as Tillich. Both point to a reality that transcends conventional categories of being and non-being. This convergence suggests a \*via negativa\* where the shattering of finite meanings can open onto an ineffable, ultimate reality experienced as both terrifying void and ecstatic fullness.
