# Deep Dive into Harshest Ascetic Practices Throughout History

  

## Christian Asceticism

  
\#### Stylitism  
\- \*\*Practices\*\*: Stylites, such as Symeon the Stylite, lived atop pillars for extended periods, often enduring extreme weather without shelter.  
\- \*\*Purpose\*\*: This practice was a physical manifestation of the ascetic's desire to be closer to God, both spiritually and physically, by distancing themselves from earthly distractions.  
  
\#### Flagellation  
\- \*\*Practices\*\*: Self-flagellation involved whipping oneself to imitate Christ’s suffering and atone for sins.

## Jain Asceticism

  
\#### Kanthapurana  
\- \*\*Practices\*\*: This involves pulling out hair from the scalp, a practice done during initiation into monkhood.

\- \*\*Practices\*\*: More radical than Sallekhana, Santhara involves voluntarily ceasing to eat or drink, often in the face of terminal illness or impending death.

\- \*\*Practices\*\*: Involving years of isolation in forests, these retreats included severe fasting, minimal shelter, and intense meditation practices.

## Hindu Asceticism

  
\#### Tapas

## Japanese Asceticism

# Some of the most extreme forms of asceticism practiced throughout history include:

  

## Severe Fasting and Starvation

\- Jain monks practice Sallekhana, a ritual fasting to death. They slowly reduce their food intake over time until they die of starvation, in order to liberate the soul.\[5\]  
\- Some early Christian ascetics like St. Simeon Stylites would fast for entire Lenten periods, to the point of being found unconscious.\[1\]  
  

## Self-Mutilation and Pain

\- In the early church, Origen of Alexandria misinterpreted a Bible verse and paid a physician to castrate him, believing it would help achieve the "kingdom of heaven".\[1\]  
\- Flagellation, or self-whipping, was common among Catholic monks and nuns like the Franciscans and Dominicans. They believed the physical suffering purified the soul.\[2\]  
\- Some Hindu fakirs in India would stare at the sun until going blind, or hold their arms up until they withered, as a radical form of self-mortification.\[3\]  
  

## Extreme Isolation and Restriction of Movement

\- St. Simeon Stylites spent 37 years praying while seated atop a 15-meter pillar, exposed to the elements.\[1\]  
\- Some Syrian Christian monks were known for walling themselves in cells in complete seclusion.\[3\]  
\- Thousands of men and women once populated the deserts of the Middle East, eager to torture themselves in isolation in exchange for paradise.\[1\]  
  

## Rejection of Hygiene

\- Inspired by Indian ascetics, the Persian prophet Mani promoted the abdication of washing as a painful ascetic practice. His followers would never cut their nails or hair and allowed dirt to accumulate on their bodies.\[3\]  
  
These are some of the most severe ascetic practices, often motivated by a belief that extreme self-denial, pain and isolation could lead to spiritual enlightenment or atonement for sins. While more moderate forms of asceticism are still practiced, these radical expressions illustrate the lengths some have gone to in hopes of transcending worldly existence.

# The Aghori Sect of Hinduism (The Shit Eaters)

Based on the provided sources, the Aghori sect's consumption of human flesh, urine, and feces is rooted in their unorthodox spiritual beliefs and practices:

1. The Aghori believe that distinctions and discrimination are delusions that hinder spiritual development. Thus, they see no difference between good and evil, pure and impure, or even human and animal flesh.\[1\]\[3\] Consuming human flesh from corpses in cremation grounds is an affirmation of this belief system.\[1\]
2. Eating human flesh, drinking urine, and consuming feces are seen as means to kill the ego, transcend dualistic notions of beauty and purity, and derail conventional perceptions.\[1\]\[4\] These shocking acts are part of their radical path to enlightenment.
3. The Aghori rail against orthodox Hindu ideas of purity and pollution.\[3\] Engaging in taboo acts like cannibalism is a rejection of mainstream norms and an embrace of the oneness of all things as divine creation.\[3\]
4. In Aghori belief, liberation (moksha) can be achieved faster by engaging in unconventional, taboo practices when done properly.\[1\] Cannibalism and consuming waste products are part of their "left-hand" tantric path to accelerated spiritual progress, despite the risks.\[1\]
5. The Aghori worship Shiva, the destroyer, and Kali, the goddess of death.\[1\]\[4\] Consuming flesh and waste in cremation grounds is an imitation of these fearsome deities who transcend dualities.\[1\] It is a way to confront death and attain power over it.

So in essence, the Aghori's extreme consumption habits are a radical expression of non-dualism, a rejection of purity norms, an embrace of the oneness of all creation, and an accelerated means to enlightenment, however shocking they may appear to outsiders. Their practices aim to transcend the ego and dualistic thinking entirely through rituals considered taboo in mainstream Hinduism.
