# The Transcendent Experience of Nihilism and Psychedelics

# Quote from Huston Smith

“I suspect that psychedelic religious experiences are having, and for the foreseeable future will continue to have, less faith-filled carryover than those that occur spontaneously...The most important one is conviction, carrying over into the non-drug state, that the insights that emerge in the theophany are true...The experience's content is certain because doubts that could enter only from the perspective of this world, which world pales before (where it is not obliterated by) the world into which the see-er has stepped...Except in the tragic case of psychotics, however, this world eventually reasserts itself and its claims press hard upon us, which claims in our culture challenge the validity of pharmacological theophanies.”

## Question Derived from Quote

"Compare and contrast the psychedelic experience with non-induced spiritual or mystical experiences. What are the qualitative differences, if any, and what does this tell us about the nature of religious or transcendental experiences in general?

  

## ChatGPT's Response 

Comparing and contrasting psychedelic experiences with non-induced spiritual or mystical experiences is a fascinating endeavor, particularly within the framework of Nihiltheism. Both types of experiences are often characterized by profound alterations in perception, consciousness, and the sense of self, but they differ in key aspects.

  

1\. \*\*Induction Method\*\*: Psychedelic experiences are chemically induced, typically through substances like LSD, psilocybin, or DMT. These substances interact with brain chemistry to produce altered states. Non-induced experiences, on the other hand, may arise spontaneously or through practices like meditation, prayer, or extreme physical exertion.

  

2\. \*\*Predictability and Control\*\*: Psychedelic experiences can be somewhat predictable in terms of timing and duration, depending on the substance and dosage. Non-induced experiences are often less predictable and can occur unexpectedly. In terms of control, psychedelic experiences are often more overwhelming and less controllable, while non-induced experiences might offer more room for conscious engagement or reflection.

  

3\. \*\*Nature of Experience\*\*: Psychedelic experiences often involve intense visual and auditory hallucinations, profound shifts in the perception of time and space, and a dissolving of the ego. Non-induced spiritual experiences may be less sensory and more characterized by feelings of oneness, peace, or an encounter with a transcendent reality. 

  

4\. \*\*Integration and Interpretation\*\*: The integration of psychedelic experiences into one's life and worldview can be complex, requiring careful reflection to make sense of the often-bewildering array of sensations and perceptions. Non-induced experiences, while also potentially challenging to integrate, may more naturally align with an individual's pre-existing religious or spiritual frameworks.

  

5\. \*\*Transformative Potential\*\*: Both types of experiences can be deeply transformative, often leading to significant shifts in values, beliefs, and attitudes toward life. The nature of the transformation might differ, with psychedelics often producing more immediate and sometimes more disruptive changes, while non-induced experiences might lead to more gradual but deeply rooted transformations.

  

- In terms of what these differences tell us about the nature of religious or transcendental experiences:

  

\- \*\*Subjectivity of Experience\*\*: Both types underscore the subjective nature of religious and spiritual experiences. They highlight how such experiences are deeply personal and can vary widely from one individual to another.

  

\- \*\*Access to Transcendent Realities\*\*: Both suggest that transcendent realities, whether interpreted as external spiritual realms or as deeper understandings of the mind, are accessible through various means, challenging the notion that there is a single path to spiritual truth.

  

\- \*\*The Role of the Brain\*\*: The profound experiences induced by psychedelics point to the brain's role in mediating spiritual experiences. This raises questions about the nature of these experiences – whether they are purely neurological or if they allow access to a reality beyond normal consciousness.

  

\- \*\*Language and Articulation\*\*: Both types of experiences often challenge the limits of language, highlighting the difficulty in articulating profound and ineffable experiences and the role of metaphor and symbolism in religious and spiritual discourse.

  

In the context of Nihiltheism, these comparisons could feed into the understanding of Transcendent Nothingness, offering insights into how different pathways might lead to similar understandings of reality, existence, and non-existence.

### \- Recommendations to Expand Mystical Writing

The quote you've provided addresses a critical distinction between psychedelic-induced religious experiences and those occurring spontaneously, focusing on the lasting conviction and perceived truth of the insights gained during such experiences. It suggests that spontaneous spiritual experiences may have a more profound and enduring impact on an individual's faith and belief systems compared to those triggered by psychedelics.

  

This quote is relevant to your draft in several ways:

  

1\. \*\*Conviction and Carryover\*\*: Your draft explores the nature of spiritual experiences through the lens of Nihilism and Transcendence, often touching on psychedelic experiences as gateways to these states. The quote challenges the lasting impact of such induced experiences compared to non-pharmacological ones, which could be a point of reflection within your discussion on the authenticity and durability of the insights gained from psychedelic experiences.

  

2\. \*\*The Reassertion of the Worldly Perspective\*\*: The quote concludes with the notion that 'this world eventually reasserts itself' and the claims of our everyday reality challenge the validity of the insights gained in psychedelic experiences. Your manuscript could incorporate this as a thematic element, especially in the sections where you discuss the return to the 'Worldly Nothing' and how ordinary reality clashes with the insights of the Transcendent experience.

  

3\. \*\*Doubts from Worldly Perspective\*\*: The quote mentions that doubts arise from the perspective of this world, which seems less real or significant compared to the spiritual world experienced during theophanies. In your draft, you could explore this tension between the doubts that emerge in ordinary consciousness and the certainty experienced in mystical states, and whether the mundane world undermines the insights of Nihilistic Transcendence.

  

4\. \*\*Challenges to Pharmacological Theophanies\*\*: The quote's skepticism towards the validity of psychedelic experiences could serve as a counterpoint to the strong advocacy for psilocybin-assisted transcendence presented in your draft. It could help balance the narrative by acknowledging the cultural and philosophical challenges these experiences face in being accepted as genuine spiritual revelations.

  

5\. \*\*Tragic Case of Psychotics\*\*: The reference to psychotics in the quote could be related to discussions on mental health and the potential dangers or limitations of seeking the Transcendent through psychedelics. This angle might be worth exploring in your draft, particularly in relation to the preparation and intention necessary for confronting the Transcendent and avoiding negative experiences.

  

Overall, the quote provides a critical perspective on the substance and significance of psychedelic experiences that could be woven into your draft to deepen the analysis of Nihilism, Transcendence, and the validity of insights gained from altered states of consciousness. It challenges the notion that pharmacologically induced experiences can deliver the same level of transformative conviction as spontaneous spiritual awakenings. This can lead to a more nuanced discussion in your draft about the nature of such experiences and their role in one's spiritual journey.

  

In your manuscript, you've already laid out a comprehensive framework for understanding Nihilism and its potential transcendental aspects, particularly in the context of psychedelic experiences. The quote you've provided could serve as a pathway to further explorations, such as:

  

1\. \*\*Integration and Interpretation\*\*: How can individuals integrate the profound experiences and insights from the psychedelic state into their everyday lives? Can these insights maintain their significance once the immediate effects of the substances have worn off?

  

2\. \*\*Comparison with Spontaneous Experiences\*\*: You may wish to compare and contrast the psychedelic experience with non-induced spiritual or mystical experiences. What are the qualitative differences, if any, and what does this tell us about the nature of religious or transcendental experiences in general?

  

3\. \*\*Cultural and Philosophical Implications\*\*: The quote touches on cultural skepticism towards pharmacologically induced spiritual experiences. You could explore how societal beliefs and values shape the interpretation and acceptance of these experiences and whether this skepticism is justified.

  

4\. \*\*Long-term Impact\*\*: The notion that 'this world eventually reasserts itself' invites a discussion on the long-term impact of psychedelic experiences. Do these experiences have a permanent transformative effect, or do they fade as the individual re-engages with the everyday world?

  

5\. \*\*Authenticity of Experience\*\*: There is an implicit question in the quote about the authenticity of the psychedelic experience versus other forms of spiritual encounters. This may prompt an examination of the criteria we use to judge the 'truth' or 'validity' of spiritual experiences and how these criteria apply to different states of consciousness.

  

By engaging with the ideas presented in this quote, you can extend the depth and breadth of your exploration in the manuscript, offering readers a more complex and nuanced understanding of the intersection between Nihilism, transcendence, and altered states of consciousness.

## Mem's Response

This quote seems to touch on a few key themes that resonate with your notes on transcendent or mystical experiences of nihilism.

  

Firstly, it discusses the concept of psychedelic religious experiences, which could be seen as a form of mystical experience. These experiences often involve a sense of transcending the ordinary boundaries of self and world, similar to the experiences of mystics in various religious traditions.

  

Secondly, the quote talks about the conviction that the insights gained during these experiences are true. This could be related to the idea of the Transcendent Echo in nihilism, the vague yet persistent 'something' that lingers amidst the experience of nihilism. Just as the psychedelic user is convinced of the truth of their insights, so too might the nihilist be convinced of the reality of the Transcendent Echo.

  

Finally, the quote mentions the challenge that our culture presents to the validity of these experiences. This could be seen as a reflection of the existential crisis provoked by nihilism, as the individual's subjective worldview dissolves into nothingness. Yet, amidst this crisis, the Transcendent Echo persists, offering a subtle hint of 'something' amidst the 'nothing'.

  

In essence, this quote seems to suggest that psychedelic experiences can provide a glimpse into the transcendent or divine, much like the experience of nihilism. However, the challenge lies in integrating these experiences into our everyday lives and maintaining the conviction of their truth in the face of cultural skepticism or dismissal.
