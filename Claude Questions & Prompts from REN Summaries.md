- 1\. To what extent does nihilism serve as an impetus or foundation for transcendental philosophies that posit forms of ultimate reality beyond the material world? What are the tensions between these perspectives, and can they be reconciled?
- 2\. How do conceptions of "the Other" or "Transcendent reality" relate to mystical and psychedelic experiences? Do these states offer genuine encounters with transcendence or merely illusions shaped by human psychology and culture?
- 3\. Does the experience of "infinite nothingness" or "cosmic meaninglessness" necessarily lead to madness, suicide, or transcendence? What other responses are possible, and how should society view individuals who report such profound revelations?

## Begs the question and assumes subjectivity is meaningful in a meaningless universe:

- 4.1 Can subjective meaning have legitimacy and value in a universe that is objectively meaningless according to nihilism? What are the philosophical implications if humans persist in finding personal meaning despite its ultimate futility?

### Rewrite, not begging the question: 

- 4.2  If humans persist in finding personal meaning despite the perspective from nihilism that the universe is ultimately meaningless, what are the implications? Is this meaning purely illusory and driven by psychological self-deception? Or does the human act of meaning-making have philosophical legitimacy even in an objectively meaningless world? What arguments can be made for or against the value, purpose, and authenticity of subjectively constructed meaning given the premise that human life has no cosmic significance?
- 5\. To what extent does academic philosophy address or avoid fundamental existential questions related to death, meaninglessness, and the human confrontation with nothingness? Should philosophy take a more experiential approach centered on phenomenology?
- 6\. How can mysticism, existentialism, and nihilism be reconciled through a common language that captures their shared recognition of life's absurdity? Is such a language possible or inherently self-contradictory?
- 7\. Does suicide represent the ultimate expression of philosophical consistency in the face of nihilism, or an evasion of the responsibility to create meaning and purpose where none exists?
- 8\. Can scientific and religious worldviews authentically engage with the profound questions of human existence, or do they require a nihilistic turning away from both materialism and faith?
- 9\. What social and psychological factors explain the rare direct encounters with nihilism and transcendental states compared to the ubiquitous inauthentic distractions of mundane life?
- 10\. To what extent is the development of a "language of nihilism" paradoxical, given the ineffable nature of nothingness and the limits of conceptual frameworks in capturing transcendent experiences?

# Five Prompts Based off “4.2”

- **4.2**: If humans persist in finding personal meaning despite the perspective from nihilism that the universe is ultimately meaningless, what are the implications? Is this meaning purely illusory and driven by psychological self-deception? Or does the human act of meaning-making have philosophical legitimacy even in an objectively meaningless world? What arguments can be made for or against the value, purpose, and authenticity of subjectively constructed meaning given the premise that human life has no cosmic significance?

1. What criteria can be used to judge the authenticity or legitimacy of meanings created by individuals in a world without objective purpose? Do traditional philosophical frameworks of ethics have relevance, or are new standards required?

  

2. How does the persistence of value-laden language and meaning-making behavior in human life square with the nihilistic belief that no objective values or meaning exist? Is this a paradox that needs reconciliation or an indication of self-deception?

  

3. Are there philosophically substantive differences between survival-oriented adaptive meanings versus more abstract ethical or aesthetic meanings invented by humans? Should these types of meaning be judged differently in relation to nihilism?

  

4. If the universe is fundamentally meaningless, could the invention of purpose by humans be seen as an act of radical creative freedom and self-overcoming rather than delusion - a triumph of the life instinct’s will-to-meaning over indifference?

  

5. What theories of meaning can justify the value and legitimacy of localized, subjective meanings while acknowledging that human life lacks cosmic significance from a universal perspective?
