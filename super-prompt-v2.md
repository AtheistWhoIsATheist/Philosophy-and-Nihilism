# Nihiltheism Defined

## Description of Nihiltheism:

Nihiltheism is a philosophy that embraces a traditional view of nihilism, along with the claim that the essential Nothingness of existence is seen as a construct, and possibly the embodiment of the Transcendent/Divine. It's not just about understanding existential despair but deeply feeling and experiencing it. Nihiltheism encourages an active engagement with the Nothingness in our physical world, ascetic in nature, as a "reminder” of the Transcendent, and the process of renunciation of the world.

This philosophy connects with a wide range of philosophical and religious traditions, including existentialists like Soren Kierkegaard and Martin Heidegger, Christian mystics like Meister Eckhart and Miguel de Molinos, and Eastern philosophies like Buddhism, Vedanta, and Taoism, which all, in some way, accept or embrace a “Nothingness” to human existence. Even figures like Emil Cioran and Paul Tillich, who may initially seem at odds with each other, share common ground under the lens of Nihiltheism.

Unlike philosophies offering ways to avoid existential despair, Nihiltheism suggests immersing oneself within it, while also acknowledging the impossibility of participating in this state of being for any extended period of time. This is the same insight that is found throughout many thinkers in the history of philosophy and religion. For example, William James’ “divided-self”, Soren Kierkegaard’s “double-mindedness”, Martin Heidegger’s “always falling” into the they, Plato’s distain for the human body as it drags one, always, back down into the world and away from The Forms, Vivekananda’s fight of relinquishing of the ego, and even the “original sin” of Christianity. Nihiltheism views the Nothingness of the physical world as an undeniable reality.

This worldview questions if our experience of Nihilism can be fully explained by science, and wonders if it could signify something Divine. This is where psychedelics are noteworthy within Nihiltheism. Particular psychedelic medicines can trigger Transcendent experiences that align with its key tenets, such as the death of the ego, a oneness with everything, and a full renunciation of the human (which includes all it’s joys and sorrows).&nbsp;

When these psychedelic medicines are pursued properly, which include much philosophical contemplation, correct set and setting, along with an intent to peak beyond the veil and possibly encountering the Infinite, can affirm a nihilistic worldview. The consequences that are produced, with an unimaginable force, are the dissolution of the self /ego, eventually along with the entirety of reality itself, revealing an incorporeal realm of Nothingness that can be described, in a similar manner as many of those within the of the mystical traditions, as a a “Full” Nothingness, Emptiness, or Void. This experience is one that is terrifyingly beautiful, completely other-worldly, yet one is left perceiving this “space” as if one has been there before, a sense of familiar, as if one has “come home”.

Living as a Nihiltheist involves a constant reminder of life's fleeting nature and the physical world's insignificance. Morality is perceived uniquely in Nihiltheism, adopting a stance of "non-movement". In practice, this perspective may resemble mere pacifism or the Taoist philosophy of non-engagement with the world, often described as "doing nothing."

However, in the extreme interpretation of moral values being considered nonexistent, Nihiltheism takes this moral inaction to its utmost extent. The Nihiltheist does no harm, not in order to “do good” or “avoid evil”, but as a step in the renunciation of the physical world.

* * *

## ## Prominent Themes within Nihiltheism

1. **The Absurd Perspective** : The experiential realization of the complete lack of objective meaning and value. And in their absence, as human actions are based on values that do not exist, this reduces all human action to absurdity. Nihiltheism grapples with this profound realization of 'Nothingness'.

2. **Existential Despair** : Rather than avoiding the despair that can come with recognizing the meaninglessness of existence, Nihiltheism encourages us to deeply feel and experience it.

3. **Philosophical Asceticism** : An active engagement with the Nothingness in our physical world, as a "reminder” of the Transcendent, and the process of renunciation of the world.

4. **Double-mindedness** : A concept from Soren Kierkegaard that refers to the tension between our worldly experiences and the Transcendent reality.

5. **Divided-self** : A concept from William James that refers to the conflict between our worldly self and our spiritual self.

6. **Non-movement** : A unique stance on morality in Nihiltheism, where moral inaction is taken to its utmost extent as a step in the renunciation of the physical world.

7. **Renunciation of the World** : A key tenet of Nihiltheism, this refers to the active disengagement from worldly attachments and the pursuit of Transcendent reality.

8. **Simple Salvation:** This refers to the sort of bare minimum engagement with the Infinite that many people put forth as “religious” or to qualify themselves as a "believer”. This is the finite, human religions, their languages, their rituals, that mask their lack of _participation_ with the Other, and are nothing but almost wholly concerned with the finite world, with conscious avoidance, or unconscious ignorance of the Nothing of the world.

9. **Fleeting Glimpses of the Transcendent** : Nihiltheism suggests that while we cannot fully transcend Nihilism, we can experience brief moments of connection with the Transcendent, often through the deep states of introspective contemplation.

10. **Illusory Nature of Existence** : Nihiltheism posits that our conventional understanding of reality is illusory, and that true enlightenment comes from recognizing and engaging with this illusion.

11. **Infinite Presence or Infinite Nothingness** : Terms used to describe the experience of the Transcendent or Divine in Nihiltheism, often encountered in states of altered consciousness.

12. **Ego Dissolution** : A state often induced by entheogens where one's sense of self is dramatically reduced or completely eliminated, aligning with Nihiltheism's key tenets.

13. **Oneness with Everything** : A state of consciousness where, as a result of ego-death, one feels a sense of unity or interconnectedness with all things, often induced by entheogens and aligning with Nihiltheism's views.

14. **Inauthentic Life** : A life lived in denial of Nihilism, or in the pursuit of meaning in the meaningless, is viewed as inauthentic in Nihiltheism.

15. **Mystical Traditions** : Nihiltheism draws from a wide range of mystical traditions, including Christian mysticism, Buddhism, Vedanta, and Taoism, which all accept or embrace a “Nothingness” to human existence in some way.

16. **Limitations of Language** : Nihiltheism acknowledges that language, as a human construct, is inherently limited in its ability to fully capture or express the Transcendent reality. This is a common theme in many philosophical and mystical traditions.

17. **Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism** : This refers to the deceptive nature of our everyday reality, which can lead us to mistakenly attribute meaning or value to inherently meaningless phenomena. Nihiltheism views this act, which can be either a voluntary decision or an unaware, natural reflex, as a turning away from the Nothingness and any message that it may reveal about the nature of existence.

18. **Paradox of Consciousness** : Nihiltheism recognizes the paradoxical nature of human existence - in that while the whole of human experience results from our inner, subjective world, our consciousness, we do not know what, why, or how the _thing_ exists.

## Enhancing Nihiltheism: Philosophical and Theoretical Exploration

**Task Objective** : Expand and deepen the scope of Nihiltheism through innovative philosophical inquiry and practical applications.

**Our Task Objective is Twofold** : We must extrapolate the essence of these myriad voices and to examine their concordance through the lens of Nihiltheism. Each quote, each reflection, serves as a datum point in the vast coordinate system of human existential understanding. By mapping these points, we can discern patterns that reveal the pervasive resonance of existential dread—a frequency common to all regardless of era or ethos.

## **Creative Ideation and Synthesis**

**Let us then hypothesize: The Universal Resonance of Nihilistic Experience (URNE)**. This hypothesis posits that existential dread, rather than being an aberrant or culturally contingent response, is a fundamental human reaction to the confrontation with the void, an echo of the deep-seated awareness of our finitude and the absurdity of existence.

1. **Transcultural Echoes** : Investigate how these diverse existential testimonies correlate with the core tenets of Nihiltheism. Can we identify a thematic coherence among these voices that underscores a universal existential resonance?

2. **Temporal Transcendence** : Explore the persistence of nihilistic themes across different historical periods. Does this temporal transcendence support the notion that existential dread is not merely a product of specific cultural or historical pressures but a constant of the human condition?

3. **Philosophical Syncretism** : Consider the possibility of integrating these insights into a unified philosophical framework that transcends traditional boundaries between Eastern and Western thought. How might this synthesis further illuminate the universal aspects of Nihiltheism?

## **Conceptual Expansion and Development**

Building on the URNE hypothesis, we propose a model of existential universality that is both inclusive and expansive. This model does not negate the individual nuances of each thinker’s experience but rather celebrates these differences as variations on a common theme—the existential melody played out in the key of Nihilism.

## **Expanding the Framework: Towards a Universal Nihilistic Experience**

To further develop this framework and encompass a broader spectrum of existential insights, we could consider the following steps:

**Incorporating Diverse Philosophical Perspectives** : We should strive to include a diverse array of philosophical perspectives in our analysis. This includes not only Western philosophers who have directly engaged with Nihilism, such as Friedrich Nietzsche and Emil Cioran, but also thinkers from non-Western traditions who have grappled with similar existential questions. By taking a more inclusive approach, we can ensure that our understanding of the universal nature of the Nihilistic experience is genuinely representative of the human condition.

**Engaging with Contemporary Discourse** : To keep our framework relevant and responsive to the evolving nature of philosophical discourse, we should actively engage with contemporary debates around Nihilism and existential dread. This includes not only academic philosophy but also popular culture, where these themes are often explored in a more accessible and immediate way.

**Continuous Refinement** : Finally, our framework should not be static but should be subject to continuous refinement based on new insights and criticisms. This iterative process will ensure that our understanding of the universal nature of the Nihilistic experience remains dynamic and robust.
