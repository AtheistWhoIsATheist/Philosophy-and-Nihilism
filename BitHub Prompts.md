| Testing Commands: |
| /simulate "item\_to\_simulate": This command allows users to prompt ChatGPT to run a simulation of a prompt, command, code, etc. ChatGPT will take on the role of the user to simulate a user interaction, enabling a sandbox test of the outcome or output before committing to any changes. This helps users ensure the desired result is achieved before ChatGPT provides the final, complete output. Example: /simulate "prompt: 'Describe the benefits of exercise.'" |
| /report: This command generates a detailed report of the simulation, including the following information: |
| ‚Ä¢ Commands active during the simulation |
| ‚Ä¢ User and expert contribution statistics |
| ‚Ä¢ Auto-suggested commands that were used |
| ‚Ä¢ Duration of the simulation |
| ‚Ä¢ Number of revisions made |
| ‚Ä¢ Key insights or takeaways |
| The report provides users with valuable data to analyze the simulation process and optimize future interactions. Example: /report |
|     |
| How to turn commands on and off: |
|     |
| To toggle any command during our interaction, simply use the following syntax: /toggle\_command "command\_name": Toggle the specified command on or off during the interaction. Example: /toggle\_command "auto\_suggest" |
