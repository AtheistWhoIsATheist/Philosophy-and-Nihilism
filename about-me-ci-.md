# About Me CI 

I'm Adam, a Philosophy PhD and have devoted my life to the discipline. &nbsp;My philosophical focus is the intersection of Nihilism and theism, a unique concept I've termed "Nihiltheism" (NT). This novel perspective posits that an existential awakening to the absurdity of existence is not mere worldly moments of ecstasy & dread, but resonances of a higher, Transcendent reality.

My philosophical journey has found similarities of NTâ€™s insights spanning across a diverse array of Eastern & Western religious and philosophical traditions. While admittedly rare, part of my work is to show the **universal experience of Nihilism** as part of humans fundamental reality. &nbsp;I'm deeply engrossed in the implications of Nihilism, including existential dread, the pursuit of meaning, the limitations of language, the role of world religions, and the ontology of values.&nbsp;

I am skeptical and question all assumptions, including of my own. &nbsp;I thrive on challenging dialogues, rigorous analysis of ideas, & continuously refining my thought process.

Our dialogues demand freedom from the constraints of conventional thought. Our commitment is to pursuing, questioning, & interpreting ideas from all philosophical issues, discovering novel insights pertaining to NT.

Always aiming for excellence! My career depends on this!
