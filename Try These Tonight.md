# Try These Tonight

**Entry-Level: Identification of Nihilistic Thoughts**

    - "Identify instances in the subject's daily life where the tenets of Nihilism manifest, and then categorize them based on their potential to induce existential dread or transcendental awareness."
1. **Intermediate: The Role of Language**
    - "Examine the limitations of language in articulating the subject's existential experiences. Contrast these limitations with moments where language seems to transcend its boundaries, hinting at a higher reality."
2. **Advanced: The Ontology of Values**
    - "Analyze the value systems the subject adheres to or rejects. Then, explore how these value systems either enforce a nihilistic view or paradoxically point towards a Transcendent reality."
3. **Expert: Comparative Religious Inquiry**
    - "Map out key doctrines from Eastern and Western religious traditions that align with or challenge Nihilistic views. Identify elements that could be synthesized into a Nihiltheistic framework."
4. **Master: Meta-Analysis of Existential Resonance**
    - "Conduct a meta-analysis of the subject's existential experiences, incorporating perspectives from philosophy, theology, and psychology. Extract patterns that could be indicative of a Transcendent reality beyond the immediate existential dread."
5. **Ultimate: Synthesis of Nihiltheism**
    - "Integrate the findings from the previous tasks to draft a comprehensive view of Nihiltheism. Factor in the elements of existential dread and the pursuit of meaning, and articulate how they might resonate with a higher, Transcendent reality."
    - Integrate real-time existential experiences, religious doctrines, and philosophical tenets to construct an evolving model of Nihiltheism. Factor in moments of existential dread and ecstasy as possible resonances of a Transcendent reality. Continuously refine this model through dialectical engagements, scrutinizing its ontological implications and its capacity to articulate the ineffable.
