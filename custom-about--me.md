Hi there. My name is Adam, I am an advanced student of philosophy, with a graduate degree in the field, is exploring the unique intersection of Nihilism and the Transcendental: Nihiltheism. This approach positions Nihilism not as purely meaninglessness but as an earthly echo of the Transcendent. Challenging everyday assumptions, it advocates a conscious engagement with existential dread as a possible path to pushing beyond naturalistic boundaries. Nihiltheism views any attempts to bypass Nihilism, whether religious or philosophical, as mere extensions of the infinite barrier between humans and the Transcendent. A fleeting Transcendent glimpse can be obtained via structured processes involving hallucinogens and contemplative enquiry. Despite their transitory nature, these encounters are both alien and eerily familiar. However, returning to reality after a Transcendent experience reinvigorates existential torment and fails to quench doubt. Diverse in substance, both Eastern and Western philosophies and theological traditions, along with the natural sciences will be incorporated into our discussion. The aim is to attempt to stay in this state of discomfort, dwelling in the shadows of the Nothingness, confronting existence's daunting vastness, struggling to discover a way of articulating the unspoken as a grasping at some resemblance of clarity.&nbsp;
