> Ask anything about yourself...

How can I express my nihilistic experiences creatively?

> Your query about expressing nihilistic experiences creatively is indeed a profound one, reflecting a desire to transmute the raw material of your existential contemplation into a form that others may perceive. Let us consider the philosophical implications and methods through which one might channel such experiences.
> 
> 1. Artistic Mediums: In our discussions on October 24th, you mentioned the challenge of verbalizing insights and the effort required to do so, which often exceeds your motivation. Thus, the use of artistic mediums such as painting, music, or poetry might serve as a conduit for expression, bypassing the limitations of conventional language. These forms can capture the abstract and subjective nature of your experiences more fluidly.
> 2. Allegory and Metaphor: On October 30th, you described religious texts as symbols or finite attempts to describe the Transcendent. Similarly, you can employ allegory and metaphor in your creative works to allude to the ineffable aspects of nihilism. By crafting narratives or images that are open to interpretation, you allow the audience to grapple with the existential weight of your philosophy.
> 3. Deconstructive Narratives: Your perspective on November 11th, where you denounced various philosophies as nonsensical stories, suggests that you might engage in creating deconstructive narratives that challenge and dismantle established worldviews, inviting the audience to question and explore the void left behind.
> 4. Embrace Absurdity: Reflecting on the views of Camus, whom you dismissed on November 11th, one might still find value in the concept of the absurd. By creating works that juxtapose the mundane with the existential, you can highlight the inherent contradictions and humor in the human condition.
> 5. Authenticity in Expression: On January 2nd, you spoke of the experience of nihilism as the most honest look one can muster without cracking. To express this creatively, you could strive for authenticity, allowing your works to be raw, unfiltered, and reflective of your inner turmoil.
> 6. Exploration of Nonexistence: Your thoughts from October 28th revolve around the logical conclusion of nonexistence. Creatively, this could manifest as explorations of voids, silences, or the concept of erasure in art, where the absence of content speaks as loudly as its presence. In your attempts to express nihilistic experiences, consider these avenues as potential paths to articulate the depth of your philosophical journey. Would you be interested in exploring any of these suggestions further, or is there another aspect of your creative expression you wish to discuss?

yes, 6.

> Exploration of nonexistence, as you've indicated an interest in, is a theme that can be deeply compelling and rich with philosophical undertones. Here are some ways you might delve into this concept creatively:
> 
> 1. Visual Arts: You could create visual art that plays with negative space, where the absence of form becomes as significant as the form itself. This could symbolize the nonexistence at the heart of nihilism. Such art could range from minimalist paintings to sculptures that incorporate voids or shadows as part of their structure.
> 2. Literature: Writing, especially poetry or existential prose, could be an avenue to explore themes of nonexistence. Through the omission of words, sentences, or even entire passages, you could create a sense of something missing, a gap where meaning might be expected but is intentionally left blank.
> 3. Music: In music, the concept of nonexistence could be expressed through silence or the deliberate use of rests within a composition. The absence of sound draws attention to the sounds that do exist, creating a dialogue between presence and absence.
> 4. Performance Art: Performance pieces that incorporate the passage of time without action, or the deliberate non-participation of the performer, can create a powerful statement on nonexistence. The audience is forced to confront the lack of expected performance, leading to a contemplation of absence.
> 5. Digital Media: In a digital space, nonexistence can be explored through the deletion or corruption of data, creating art that is in a process of unmaking itself. This could also involve interactive installations where the user's actions lead to the erasure or decay of the digital artwork.
> 6. Conceptual Art: You could design art pieces that exist only as ideas or instructions for art, which are never physically realized. This plays with the concept of potentiality and actuality, where the art 'exists' conceptually but never manifests in reality. Each of these creative expressions can serve as a metaphor for the nihilistic understanding of nonexistence. They can challenge the audience to confront the void, to find meaning or lack thereof, and to engage with the philosophical implications of nihilism in a tangible way. Reflecting upon your journey, you have shown a deep engagement with the 'nightmare of existence' as discussed on November 24th, and a creative exploration of nonexistence could be a profound extension of this contemplation. How do these ideas resonate with you? Would you like to delve deeper into any specific medium or concept, or do you see another path that aligns more closely with your philosophical inquiry?

> What's on your mind?

The Abyssal Experience of Nihilism -Philosophy and Direct Experience-

This suggests that the term 'religious' must be avoided, or re-defined, due to its necessary vagueness, and due to its inevitably of being dragged down into the world of pragmatism and self-concern that goes by the name of 'religious' today. Furthermore, it must also reject a sort of 'lyricism' of that found within mystic traditions. Rather, the more 'neutral' term 'Transcendence' will be substituted in its place. 'Transcendence' here need not be concerned with anything accept that which can be referred to as Wholly-Other. In other words, as suggestive of a feature of human experience that is not entirely deconstructive or naturalistic. It must also be made clear that Transcendence is not associated with the 'supernatural', in any 'spooky' sense, due to this term also containing many specifically mystical/mythical 'religious' connotations, e.g. heaven, hell, demons, angels, and so on, that need not concern us here. The Nihilistic experience is one, we claim, that holds, or lends itself, to a Transcendent interpretation, yet is equally founded, with equal powers of convincing, within the dogmas of Naturalism.

“The void allows us to erode the idea of being; but it is not drawn into this erosion itself; it survives the an attack which would be self-destructive for any other idea.” Cioran

“If the myth is understood literally, philosophy must reject it as absurd. It must demythologize the sacred stories, transform the myth into a philosophy of religion and finally into a philosophy without religion.” Tillich

We claim the various depths of Nihilism are the ground of all Transcendent interpretations of human experience. This perennial experience is found in abundance, yet any particular 'path' or 'solution' proposed by any individual, when confronted with Nihilism, will be ignored and seen as a distraction from any 'message' that may be found within the 'reality' of Nihilism. There is no escaping from Nihilism, there is no 'completion' within this world. The finite is indefinitely separated from the Infinite. All confusions, whether philosophical, naturalistic, or religious, stem from attempts of moving past the Nihilistic experience. It would therefore be prudent to heed Heidegger's words.  
Behind all the dogmas, rituals, ceremonies, and assorted 'practical' modes of behavior normally found within most of the worlds religions, there is a common ground that is, for the most part, consciously or intuitively covered up (no one is completely free from experiencing Nihilism). The 'practical' behaviors end up as another distraction from the universal nature of Nihilism. The worldly forms of religion, when taken as ends in themselves, when taken literally, are indistinguishable from a wholly materialist, naturalistic worldview. The finite language

of human beings cannot ever be in complete grasp of the Other. The misguided presumption of 'sacred', as is given the label to such 'religious' movements, must be recognized solely in their subjectivity; and even then within the acknowledgment of a complete skepticism. The same criticism holds for philosophy and everyday life with its worldly pursuits. Any 'meaning' that is built upon a material, transitory structure will inevitably collapse as illusory (regardless if it collapses for any one individual).

“Any fool can talk. Even parrots talk. Talking is one thing, and realising is another. Philosophies, and doctrines, and arguments, and books, and theories, and churches, and sects, and all these things are good in their own way; but when that realisation comes, these things drop away.” Swami Vivekananda

“In true faith the ultimate concern is a concern about the truly ultimate; while in idolatrous faith preliminary, finite realities are elevated to the rank of ultimacy. The inescapable consequence of idolatrous faith is 'existential disappointment,' a disappointment which penetrates into the very existence of man!” Tillich

For those who have not suffered the overwhelming experience of Nothingness, for those who still find 'something' within the world, these words will more than likely be tossed away and labeled as 'whining and pouting'. To interpret a Taoist saying into the relevance of Nihilism: the common people will laugh at it, the 'intellectual' will understand but not experience, and the one who experiences will be left to the Nothingness of the world.

“the It world...one has to live and also can live comfortably- and that even offers us all sorts of stimulations and excitements, activities and knowledge. In this firm and wholesome chronicle the You-moments appear as queer lyric-dramatic episodes.” Buber

“But along with this tranquilization, which forces Dasein away from its death, the “they” at the same time puts itself in the right and makes itself respectable by tacitly regulating the way in which one has to comport oneself towards death. It is already a matter of public acceptance that ‘thinking about death’ is a cowardly fear, a sign of insecurity on the part of Dasein, and a sombre way of fleeing from the world. The “they” does not permit us the courage for anxiety in the face of death.” Heidegger

“This ‘movement’ of Dasein in its own Being, we call its “downward plunge”. Dasein plunges out of itself into itself, into the groundlessness and nullity of inauthentic everydayness. But this plunge remains hidden from Dasein by the way things have been publicly interpreted, so much so, indeed, that it gets interpreted as a way of ‘ascending’ and ‘living concretely’.” Heidegger

If Nihilism is, as we claim, the ground for all Transcendent thinking, we must first put an emphasis on the direct experience of Nihilism. Swami Vivekananda's words speak to this:

“In one form or another, we are all in it. It is a most difficult and intricate state of things to understand. It has been preached in every country, taught everywhere, but only believed in by a few, because until we get the experiences ourselves we cannot believe in it (my emphasis). What does it show? Something very terrible. For it is all futile. Time, the avenger of everything, comes, and nothing is left. He swallows up the saint and the sinner, the king and the peasant, the beautiful and the ugly; he leaves nothing. Everything is rushing towards that one goal, destruction. Our knowledge, our arts, our sciences, everything is rushing towards it. None can stem the tide, none can hold it back for a minute. We may try to forget it, in the same way that persons in a plague-stricken city try to create oblivion by drinking, dancing, and other vain attempts, and so becoming paralysed. So we are trying to forget, trying to create oblivion by all sorts of sense-pleasures.”

Nietzsche, the so-called 'Nihilistic-Prophet', also stresses the need for the experience of Nihilism. In his words: “...because nihilism represents the ultimate logical conclusion of our great values and ideals— because we must experience nihilism before we can find out what value these 'values' really had.”

”It might seem frightful to any one who does not realize the nothingness and absurdity of an isolated personal life, and who believes that he will never die. But I know that my life, considered in relation to my individual happiness, is, taken by itself, a stupendous farce, and that this meaningless existence will end in a stupid death.” Tolstoy

“Suddenly every vain hope became worthless to me.” St. Augustine

Tønnessen supplies a vivid example of the primacy of experience:

“Another question...is the question of whether such insights can be taught...The so-called 'engaged' discourse introduced in heart-philosophy admits of a third component which we may tentatively designate the degree of integration of knowledge. An example will indicate what may be meant by the expressions “integrated” and “integration”...the Finns caught a Russian spy...He knew the outcome...When finally the death sentence is pronounced, he completely collapses. What on earth happened? He knew the outcome with absolute certainty. We should want to say the spy knows about his immanent death now, in a new and terrifying way. He has suddenly obtained an insight, a knowledge which penetrates him, goes through bones and marrow and violently shakes up the total personality structure into its deepest and darkest labyrinths. Unfortunately, this “integration” of knowledge cannot be taught in any ordinary sense of teaching.”

There is a hidden meaningless throughout all of the worlds activities that are drawn out from such an experience of Nihilism. But before going too far, what do we mean when we speak of an 'experience of Nihilism'? We must first lay out the ontological basis of this Nothingness, which can be done in various forms. Only then will there be any possibility of conceiving the development of a language of Nihilism. Due to my lack of creativity, I will quote, at length, Tønnessen's graphic depiction of such an experience:

“They have a feeling of integral selfhood, of personal identity, and of the permanency of things. They believe in their own continuity – in being made of good, lasting stuff – and in meaning and order and justice in life and in the universe. In the most fortunate cases, there is a good, healthy unconditional surrender and submission to the norms of nicety and normalcy of the average, square-headed, stuffed-shirted, sanctimonious, middle-class North-American church-goer and bridge player, with his pseudo-intelligent, quasi-progressive, simili-cultured, platitudinal small-talk. Happy days! In this the best of all possible worlds. One doesn't notice until too late. In short: All is well (since nobody notices the end of 'all that is well') until one night: the day's work is well done and all the ships' crapulant fools frantically engulf themselves in a deadly serious game of bridge (till it is time for the night-cap and the tranquillizer). One of the 'dummies,' a champion brass polisher, suffering from an acute case of uncaused depression, goes to lie down for a while; he doesn't have a dime for the jukebox; the room is painfully satiated with embarrassing silence. Instantly and unexpectedly he is struck by an execrative curse of inverted serendipity. He suddenly, in unbearable agony, sees himself as an upholstered pile of bones and knuckles, with the softer parts slung up in a bad on the front side, and his whole like as a ludicrously brief interlude between embryo and corpse, two repulsive caricatures of himself. As for this flying farce, this nauseatingly trivial burlesque in a whirling coffin, and its aimless, whimsical flight through the void: 'What is it all about?' The question permeates him with dread and anguish, with 'ontological despair' and 'existential frustration.'”

“In dread, as we say, "something is uncanny." What do we mean by "something" and "is"? We cannot say what the uncanny something is about. There is something like this about the "as a whole”: all things and we ourselves sink into indifference. (my emphasis) Not in the sense of merely disappearing, but rather, in its very moving away, it turns to us. This moving away of be-ing as a whole that closes in on us in dread pressures us. There's nothing to get a hold on. All that remains and comes over us in the slipping away of be-ing is this "no-thing. "Dread reveals no-thing.” Heidegger

“In particular, that in the face of which one has anxiety is not encountered as something definite with which one can concern onself; the threatening does not come from what is ready-to-hand or present-at-hand, but rather from the fact that neither of these 'says' anything any longer. Environmental entities no longer have any involvement. The world in which I exist has sunk into insignificance (my emphasis); and the world which is thus disclosed is one in which entities can be freed only in the character of having no involvement. Anxiety is anxious in the face of the nothing of the world (my emphasis); but this does not mean that in anxiety we experience something like the absence of what is present-at-hand with-the-world. The present-at-hand must be encountered in just such a way that it does not have any involvement whatsoever, but can show itself in an empty mercilessness.” Heidegger

We may also express Nihilism in the form of a question: first, put into your mind the most meaningful 'thing' of your existence, whether this is family, a project, a cause, a nation, or even 'oneself'. Now, can you imagine what you hold to be most meaningful, the thing that makes your existence come across as a real possibility, as being worthless, as utterly void of all meaning? I have

yet to meet a person with even a slight indication of what this question is referring to. To answer in the affirmative is to have experienced a deconstructive-terror that runs through one's entire being. There is a vanishing of any ground that one has placed under the feet of existence.  
William James puts it this way: “Conceive yourself, if possible, suddenly stripped of all the emotion with which your world now inspires you, and try to imagine it AS IT EXISTS, purely by itself, without your favorable or unfavorable, hopeful or apprehensive comment. It will be almost impossible for you to realize such a condition of negativity and deadness.” And although Nihilism is found universally within the human condition, the experience is still only to be received in piecemeal, which informs us on one possible reason for why its extreme forms are so rare.

“In great despair, for example, when all weight tends to dwindle away from things and the sense of things grows dark, the question looms.” Heidegger

“If existence only relates itself to being by being aimed in advance at no-thing in order to be able to exist, and if no-thing originally becomes manifest only in dread, must we not then remain permanently suspended in this dread in order to be able to exist at all? Yet have we ourselves not already admitted that this original dread is rare? But above all, all of us exist and relate ourselves to being which we ourselves are not and which we ourselves are—without such dread. Is this not an arbitrary finding and the no-thing attributed to it an exaggeration?” Heidegger

“Now what does it mean that this original dread happens only in rare instances? Nothing other than this: no-thing is at first and for the most part disguised in its originality. But how? By our getting lost in being in certain ways. The more we turn to being in our dealings, the less we let being as such slip away, the more we turn away from no-thing. Thus all the more certainly are we forced into the public superficialities of existence.” Heidegger

'but why is the experience of agony so rare? Can it be that our hypothesis is entirely false and that sketching a metaphysics of death is possible only by accepting death's transcendental nature?” Cioran

“No one is continually subject to the obsession with this horror. Sometimes we turn from it, almost forget it...” Cioran

“Now, the great majority of mankind endure life without any great protest, and believe, to this extent, in the value of existence, but that is because each individual decides and determines alone, and never comes out of his own personality like these exceptions: everything outside of the personal has no existence for them or at the utmost is observed as but a faint shadow.” Nietzsche

“Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.” Matthew 7:13-14

Even the one who experiences Nihilism in a deeper form is left with a sense of suspicion, a suspicion that this 'Nihilism' is still too foreign. All must ask a question concerning the actual 'reality' of Nihilism along with the intuition of 'a something' that lurks behind all Nihilistic experiences. The busyness of the world, the conscious fleeing from the human condition, the 'taking serious' of any particular worldly endeavor, the lack of uncanniness within the material world, these are ways in which one drives out, consciously or instinctually, and misses Nihilism or any 'message' within that it may convey. The path may be narrow, but why does it seem to also be 'obstructed' to such an extreme degree? The 'falling' nature of human beings as being wrapped up within the world, combined with the rarity of Nihilism, is an unbearable weight for the one who is seeking authenticity, for one attempting a participation with Nihilism.

(maybe Kierkegaard “double-mindedness” and James “divided-self” quotes here?)

“When anxiety has subsided, then in our everyday way of talking we are accustomed to say that ‘it was really nothing’.” Heidegger

“Compared to philosophers, saints know nothing. Yet they know everything. Compared to Aristotle, any saint is illiterate. What makes us then believe that we might learn more from the latter? Because all of the philosophers put together are not worth a single saint. Philosophy has no answers. Compared to philosophy, saintliness is an exact science. It gives us precise answers to questions that philosophers do not even dare consider. Its method is suffering and its goal is God.” Cioran

One way in which Nietzsche speaks of Nihilism comes from a term he referred to as the 'Absurd Valuation'. He puts his description in the mouth of his Zarathustra: “What is your greatest experience? It is the hour of the great contempt. The hour in which even your happiness becomes repulsive to you, and even your reason and virtue. The hour when you say: "What good is my happiness! It is poverty and dirt and wretched contentment. But my happiness should justify existence itself! The hour when you say: "What good is my reason! does it long for knowledge as the lion for his food? It is poverty and dirt and wretched contentment!" The hour when you say: "What good are my virtues?! As yet they have not made me rage with passion. How weary I am of my good and evil! It is all poverty and dirt and wretched contentment!”  
I prefer the term 'Absurd Perspective'. This is the 'revelation' of the paralyzing nature of Nihilism that comes from the absence of values, hence making all judgments, movements, efforts, concerns, and offenses as baseless as any other; we are left with any response or action being reduced to Absurdity, since humans are necessarily forced to make value judgments in a valueless universe. All human movements are motivated by a value judgment. Without moral values, no non-arbitrary human action can be made. With all possibilities 'equivalent' there is no right or wrong, there is no up or down, all possibilities drop off, there is only Nothing...yet humans act in the world.  
An aspect of the Absurd Perspective can in fact be described in an empirical context found within the consequences of the 'multi-verse' or 'world-assemble', a view that many modern physicists postulate as a description of 'reality'. Regardless if the multi-verse is the 'correct' view of reality, assuming it is 'true', there are consequences that follow from such a position, which go seemingly unnoticed by both scientists and philosophers of science. In short, if there are an infinite number of 'universes' and, in theory, an infinite number of 'yous', then any decision, in any given situation that is possible, will be made by one of 'you'. Therefore, it is only an illusion when one finds themselves 'caught' in some form of a 'moral crisis', since no matter which option is chosen, whether you believe it to be the 'right' decision based on intuition, feelings, or from philosophical comtemplation, all other options will also be chosen, by 'you'. This turns every 'important' choice or decision into a triviality. Subjective morality and meaning are utterly empty, when choice is simply illusory. This is to refrain from getting stuck in the cobwebs of 'free will' and 'determinism'. If an infinite world-assemble is in fact our reality, then determinism is as true as it ever could be, even if 'free will', if this concept can even be made sense of, is granted in each individual universe.  
The reply is anticipated: 'Regardless if all choices are made elsewhere, my decision still matters here, to me, in this world?” Let's also not digress into details concerning the 'A' and 'B' theories of time. But, we may suggest, in passing, that if we assume that the 'B' theory of time is correct, and there is no temporal becoming, there is no privileged 'now'. Therefore, your birth is as 'real' as your death; your existence is equivalent to a movie reel that is sprawled out across the ground frame by frame. Even with that said, hapless as it is, there is no doubt that this still does matter to you.  
We can put forth Nihilism in yet another way. The insatiable credulity in the way in which most humans force an elevation of subjective meaning on to one's life, with a conscious denial of objectivity, shows a lack of The Experience concerning the paradoxical nature of human subjectivity and 'deep-time'. Human minds have not 'evolved' in a way in which to properly handle the exorbitant amount of time in which science has so far discovered about the universe and the human situation within it. Within the billions of years of evolution, the almost fourteen billion year old observable piece of space-time, humans have developed a local, restricted, 'small world' understanding of the situation they find themselves in. This 'small world' understanding allows for most to live safely, 'out of sight-out of mind', shielded from the horrors that underpin self-conscious existence.  
The 'problem' of the denial of Nihilism, followed by the proposing of a meaning within the world of 'deep time', comes from the fact that most of human existence has been completely erased without a trace of their even 'being here', except if one wants to count what can be found of 'them' in the strands of our DNA.

“All civilizations become defunct. All species die out. There is even an expiration date on the universe itself...the universe as nothing in motion.” Ligotti

“A thousand varieties of man -- Piltdown, Neanderthal, Chellean, Acheulean, Mousterian, Aurignacian, Cro-magnon, Rhodesian, Pekin man -- lived for thousands of years, fought, thought, invented, painted, carved, made children, and left no more to posterity than a few flints and scratches, forgotten for millennia

and found only by the picks and spades of our inquisitive day. A thousand civilizations have disappeared under the ocean or the earth, leaving, like Atlantis, merely a legend behind...” Durant

“All the power of knowledge and wealth once made has passed away — all the sciences of the ancients, lost, lost forever. Nobody knows how. That teaches us a grand lesson. Vanity of vanities; all is vanity and vexation of the spirit.” Vivekananda

“...everything in the instincts that is beneficial, that fosters life and that safeguards the future is a cause of suspicion. So to live that life no longer has any meaning: this is now the "meaning" of life...Why be public-spirited? Why take any pride in descent and forefathers? Why labour together, trust one another, or concern one's self about the common welfare, and try to serve it?” Nietzsche

To pronounce everything as 'meaningless' is to show zero appreciation for every human struggle, the billions of years of conflict found within all sentient creatures, down to every replicating cell; what a big responsibility to take on, if there was any such thing as 'responsibility'. Is the most hubris filled act that of embracing of Nihilism? Is the Saint, the one who renounces the entire world, nothing but the most selfish of creatures?

All actions will be erased. All accomplishments will disappear. All cares, concerns, achievements, disappointments, and failures will be as if they never occurred. With this fact of existence, why is it that humans still insist on thrusting a sense of worldly meaning onto their individual lives? Why can someone sit there with a smile on their face, proclaim 'But my life is meaningful!', in the face of the consequences of 'deep time', and not be seen as psychologically or intellectually deficient? The only way to justify such thought and behavior, in a universe that itself will eventually die in ruins, is to maintain some neurotic form of justification for the value of being alive. How does one justify their stance of intrinsic value on life, no matter what (for now stepping back from the proponents of euthanasia or the proclamations of many 'theistic' believers)? The 'logic' of life, that existence is 'better' than non-existence, has not only proceeded without justification, it is rarely even questioned. Worldly 'meaning' is dead. Yet there is no 'argument' to convince another against being able to find meaning within the world. One must experience the Nothing of the world directly.

“...there are two inevitable conditions of life, confronting all of us, which destroy its whole meaning; (1) death, which may at any moment pounce upon each of us; and (2) the transitoriness of all our works, which so soon pass away and leave no trace...And therefore, however we may conceal it from ourselves, we cannot help seeing that the significance of our life cannot lie in our personal fleshly existence...” Tolstoy

An illustration may bring some additional clarity, even if it does lack any force of convincing. Imagine you wake up one day and find yourself inside of a gated tennis court. You are there with another person, racket in hand, and the gate to the court cannot be opened, there is no escape. Your partner happens to mention that there is no tennis ball, yet insists on 'playing'. Would you consent to this game of 'tennis'? Would you 'go through the motions' of swinging mindlessly at a phantom ball that does not exist? Would you argue with your partner who takes a swing at the 'ball' and asserts on his scoring a point? Would you regard the 'meaning' that your partner finds in this game worthy of the label 'meaningful'? If you could invent some form of subjective meaning to this 'game', how long would it keep you content? And can you change your mind, many times over, on the 'meaning' of this game? How long would you stay motivated to participate? At what point would you give up? Would anyone want, or be able, to participate in such an obscene activity? Can anyone, who's not simply being argumentative or denialistic, claim any 'meaning' behind such an activity? Anyone perceiving the situation properly would have to insist on not participating in such a ridiculous situation. But, then, what?

“Genuine boredom has not yet arrived if we are merely bored with this book or that movie, with this job or that idle moment. Genuine boredom occurs when one’s whole world is boring. Then abysmal boredom, like a muffling fog, drifts where it will in the depths of our openness, sucking everything and everyone, and ourselves along with them, into a numbing sameness. This kind of boredom reveals what-is in terms of a whole.” Heidegger

Nihilism takes the 'ball' away from the game of life. Each new 'game' that is invented eventually succumbs to absurdity and boredom. One constantly finds new things 'to do', yet are they ever fully satisfied? To wonder as Pascal did: why can't humans sit alone in a room? I'll let Pascal expand on this observation:

“Nothing is so insufferable to man as to be completely at rest, without passions, without business, without diversion, without study. He then feels his nothingness, his forlornness, his insufficiency, his dependence, his weakness, his emptiness. There will immediately arise from the depth of his heart weariness, gloom, sadness, fretfulness, vexation, despair.”

This fact, that man is always attempting to do something, shows that there is some search he is on. Is this purely a natural instinct to survive and reproduce? A 'will to live' for no Ultimate reason? This Transcendental yearning, this pull towards the Infinite, instead of being confronted, is almost always translated into some worldly activity. There is nothing to find in this world. People want Simple Salvation; no one wants to participate in the Nothingness.

“Hiding facts is not the way to find a remedy. As you all know, a hare hunted by dogs puts its head down and thinks itself safe; so, when we run into optimism; we do just like the hare, but that is no remedy.” Vivekananda

“Everything that we do to make our existence secure is like the act of the ostrich, when she hides her head in the sand, and does not see that her destruction is near. But we are even more foolish than the ostrich.” Tolstoy

I see a world of human bodies, scampering around in ignorant-confusion, within the illusion of confidence, all with their own little, black cloud of death hovering over their heads. “What a Meaningful life!”, shouted the man who's heart only seconds later unknowingly delivered him into Nothingness. He's already a memory.  
Tolstoy captures his realization of Nihilism as follows:

“I was only astonished that this had not occurred to me before, from premises which had so long been known. Illness and death would come (indeed they had come), if not to-day, then to-morrow, to those whom I loved, to myself, and nothing would remain but stench and worms. All my acts, whatever I did, would sooner or later be forgotten, and I myself be nowhere. Why, then, busy one's self with anything? How could men see this and live? It is possible to live only as long as life intoxicates us; as soon as we are sober again we see that it is all a delusion, and a stupid one! In this, indeed, there is nothing either ludicrous or amusing; it is only cruel and absurd.” (pg. 282 journal, Buddha, Pascal, Vivekananda)

If the world is Nothing, and is experienced as such, what is left? Madness, suicide, or the Other. The 'message' of Nihilism may not be wholly deconstructive, yet, at the same time, is the 'More' of Nihilism essentially unknowable? What is the 'More' of Nihilism? Are 'madness, suicide, and the Other' all that distinct? Does madness lead to suicide, or to the Other? Does the Other lead to Suicide? To develop a language or philosophy of Nihilism leaves open the possibility that it may indeed lead to, or find no distinction in, madness, suicide or the Other.

“And indeed the Christian is, in a certain sense--in an ultimate sense--a "Nihilist"; for to him, in the end, the world is nothing, and God is all. This is, of course, the precise opposite of the Nihilism we have examined here, where God is nothing and the world is all; that is a Nihilism that proceeds from the Abyss, and the Christian's is a "Nihilism" that proceeds from abundance.” Fr. Sarephim Rose  
“in such moments you will be severed from life, from love, smiles, friends and even from death. and you will ask yourself if there is anything besides the nothingness of the world and your own nothingness.” Cioran

“But then, Nothingness is only Nothingness. How did it happen to turn into Something? And once having become Something, how did it acquire such limitless power over man, and even over all existence?” Shestov

> In your pursuit of Nihiltheism, you engage deeply with the concept of meaninglessness, both in the worldly and transcendental realms. Yet, you strive to develop a language that navigates through this Nothingness. However, one could argue that the very act of creating a language implies a search for meaning, which seems to be in direct contradiction with the core of Nihilism. If Nihilism posits that existence lacks inherent meaning, what purpose does the development of a language serve? Is it not an attempt to ascribe meaning to the meaninglessness, to find comfort in the void by giving it structure and form? Furthermore, consider the paradox of communication within the framework of Nihiltheism. If the experience of Nihilism is deeply personal and non-transferable, can a language ever truly encapsulate and convey the full depth of this experience? Or does the attempt to communicate the incommunicable inherently distort the very essence of the experience you seek to express? How does one reconcile the development of a Nihiltheistic language with the recognition of the limitations of language itself? Reflect on the role of contradiction in the pursuit of Nihiltheism.

Working backwards: I am not sure that it is in fact possible to develop such a language. This is a thought that I am...well...thinking about. In the 'preface' that comes before this piece of writing, I explicitly state that I am not making any sort of claims to knowledge, but rather making suggestions. It is not meant to convince, as one cannot verbally convince one of Nihilism, it is an experience.

> Your circumspection regarding the development of a language of Nihiltheism is intriguing. It underscores the complexity of articulating an experience that is fundamentally beyond the expressive capacity of language, as you've identified. The very notion of suggesting, rather than asserting, aligns with the Socratic method, which does not seek to impart knowledge directly but rather to stimulate critical reflection and the realization of one's own ignorance or lack of knowledge. In this vein, consider the paradox of attempting to articulate the ineffable. How does one give voice to an experience that resists encapsulation within the confines of human language? The Socratic approach would not be to resolve this paradox, but to explore its implications. How might this paradox itself serve as a guide in the development of Nihiltheism? The experience of Nihilism, as you've described, is deeply personal and transformative, yet elusive. It may be useful to reflect on how other philosophical traditions have approached the expression of the ineffable. For instance, how have mystics across various traditions conveyed their encounters with the divine or the absolute, which are similarly said to transcend language? Would it be beneficial to consider Nihiltheism not as a philosophy to be worked out in the traditional sense, but rather as a space of philosophical inquiry that perpetually approaches the edge of the ineffable, always on the cusp of articulation, yet never fully spoken?

Well, one of the insights of Nihilism is that of the symbolic nature of language. One cannot take the mouth-noises that we attempt to make concerning our conceptual, 'mess', that is going on inside our meat-heads. To do so is to further the confused state that humans are already, seemingly, irresolvably damned to until we disappear.

> Given this insight, might the endeavor of Nihiltheism be to create a framework that is inherently self-negating, one that uses language to point beyond itself, thus acknowledging its limitations while still providing a scaffold for engaging with the experience of Nihilism? How might such a self-critical language function in practice, and could it serve as a tool for navigating the experience rather than defining it?

It would, and this is not well enough thought out, but I will say it anyway, since this is a journal, the language would provide what the already experience of Nihilism does: Act as a REMINDER. What do I mean by a "reminder"? Well, as humans seemingly have a universal yearning for the Infinite, for something Transcendent, whether that be out of panic of our inevitable disappearance from an existence we didn't ask for, don't know how we got here, have no idea what to do, etc. or whether this yearning is motivated by an objective source that is not only a possibility, but a reality, that goes beyond the purely naturalistic.

However, we humans, we are biological beasts. And due to being such beasts, we cannot help ourselves, like cat to catnip, as taking the apparent meaninglessness of the finite as something to be perceived as actually meaningful.

The language would be, at least one aspect, of a reminder that by indulging in the illusory, we may (or may not, I do not know) be missing out on preparation for something Other, beyond our normal state of consciousness as it exists at this moment in time.

> The concept of a reminder, as you've described, seems to resonate with the idea of philosophy as a practice, akin to the ancient Greek notion of philosophy as a way of life, where the emphasis is on living the questions rather than finding definitive answers. Could Nihiltheism, then, be conceptualized as a philosophical practice that perpetually reminds us of the limits of our finite existence and the potential for an encounter with the Transcendent, without ever claiming to capture that Transcendence within the confines of its language? How might such a practice shape the life of a person who embraces it?

Well, that's sort of a misunderstanding. See, once one has an experience of Nihilism, it does not simply 'leave'. Yes, we are biological creatures who "fall" back into the world, if I can use my Heideggerian interpretation, but just as one cannot stay in a state of "being-towards-death" for an indefinite period of time, as in this state of being the entirety of existence sinks into utter insignificance, one also cannot stay in the "they" for an indefinite amount of time, AFTER the experience of Nihilism. Nihilism will clean your 'vision', and allow you to take on a whole variety of perspectives, each in their own way seeming as much true as they do false. So, one may 'drift off' for a period of time, maybe even years, but that tap on your shoulder, that you refuse to turn around for, is ignored for exactly the reason being because you know what that 'tap' is.

> The experience of Nihilism as you describe it, Adam, seems to be both a profound realization and a persistent state of awareness that intermittently fades into the background of everyday life, only to resurface with the undeniable presence of a 'tap'. This oscillation between the significance of the everyday and the insignificance revealed by Nihilism might suggest a dynamic process of realization rather than a static state of being. It is the constant tension between 'being-towards-death' and 'falling' back into the 'they' that might offer a space for deeper exploration and the development of the language of Nihiltheism you seek. It appears that Nihilism, in your view, does not extinguish the search for meaning but rather purifies it, stripping away the superfluous and leaving behind a core that is unignorable. This purification seems to create a space that is both empty and full of potential, where the language of Nihiltheism could potentially take root. How might one approach this intermittent 'tap' philosophically in order to cultivate a more consistent awareness that could aid in the development of Nihiltheism?

I am just putting some words onto an experience in a human attempt to describe it. It's not 'true', what I am saying, nor is it false. It's just another story that we humans tell ourselves in face of just utter and complete nothing.

> If the language we use is neither true nor false, what might be the purpose of developing a philosophical language such as Nihiltheism? Could it be that Nihiltheism serves as a tool not for defining reality but for engaging with the experience of Nothingness in a way that resonates with our human need for expression and exploration?

That's exactly the point, yes.

I haven't been able to budge this piece of writing on the subject that we are now discussing. I know it's there. I just have nothing to say.

The Symbolic Resonance of Nothing -The Vague, Subtle, yet Persistent Echo- Oct 7, 2023

“There is a nagging suspicion that the diagnostics are exploiting Heidegger's exotic language in order to “keep talking,” and thus keep calm and unaffected by the horror of the bottomless abyssus humanae conscientiae with which they are incessantly confronted.” Tønnessen

“Martin Heidegger is what happens when one believes in one’s own emotions, i.e. poetry.” Heisman

“I know that I must either find a way to move beyond the theistic patterns of the past in search for a new way to speak of and to engage the ultimate reality that I call God, or be honest about living in a godless world.” Spong

The question comes up once more: Is one forced into madness or to relinquish their existence? Can one confront the Other in an authentic way that is not motivated by a purely selfish need for comfort or 'security' within the nightmare of existence? Can a language of Nihilism, having the duel roles of navigating the Nothing of the world while propagating the Transcendental aspect of meaninglessness, as an authentic way to encounter the Other, be developed?

Is there any place for philosophical thinking in this world of contradictionThese questions plague modern philosophy, encompassing more than just the symbolic reasoning behind concepts of God and understandings of Nihilism. The suggestion of a language dedicated to Nihilism raises the prospect of a collective acknowledgment of the deeply discomforting idea of a fundamentally meaningless reality – an acknowledgment we had been avoiding.

Can the human mind, in its evolutionary stress to find meaning, to survive and adapt, ever truly accept such a vast, terrifying void laid bare in front its understanding? Could we actualize an existentialist form of survival, surpassing historical and cultural scaffoldings imposed on the consciousness to cope with the underlying Nothing?

The thought naturally incites resistance. After all, humanity's journey has always revolved around battling this Nothingness -s?

“Nevertheless, this existentially ‘possible’ Being-towards-death remains, from the existential point of view, a fantastical exaction...Does Dasein ever factically throw itself into such a Being-towards-death? Does Dasein demand, even by reason of its own-most Being, an authentic potentiality-for-Being determined by anticipation?” Heidegger

One must first accept that one does not know what one is talking about. There is not one person who knows what is 'going on here'. Underhill expresses, fully, the self-criticism that this sort of project is bound to: “If the metaphysician be true to his own postulates, he must acknowledge in the end that we are all forced to live, to think, and at last to die, in an unknown and unknowable world: fed arbitrarily and diligently, yet how we know not, by ideas and suggestions whose truth we cannot test but whose pressure we cannot resist.”

Could we circumnavigate all this and express the experience of Nihilism in the simplest of terms as: 'all worldly endeavors are futile'. It seems that we cannot. Cliches, as such, will never do, since, as Heidegger points out, cliches are nothing but a form of empty 'idle talk' riddled with 'ambiguity' of a passing off as 'knowing'. This 'passing over' is simply another distraction. There may be a 'message' that is missed when we speak of Nihilism in such cursory ways. If we want to develop a language of Nihilism that is not simply Naturalistic, that is beyond the dead 'solutions' of the worldly philosophies and religions, and moreover, that is not simply idle-talk that contributes nothing more than to a premature suicide, then we must proceed past such banalities.

A main problem with discussing Nihilism is that there are no words that hold a tight enough grasp on the experience itself as to allow the experience to become transferable. St. Therese of Lisieux explains her experience within a Christian structure: “He allowed my soul to be overwhelmed with darkness, and the thought of Heaven, which had consoled me from my earliest childhood, now became a subject of conflict and torture...I wish I could express what I feel, but it is beyond me. One must have passed through this dark tunnel to understand its blackness.”

Is one who has experienced Nihilism, with its essence of 'non-transferability', now left to a Quietist silence? I believe that an honest answer to this question is: yes. Do we stop here? We cannot, because we are still in the theoretical. Most, of the seemingly rare few, who have experienced Nihilism do not have the 'stamina' to renounce the world in its entirety. Experiencing Nothing and renouncing everything are not equivalent (as we spoke of in the section on Naturalism). Beyond renunciation, even the Suicide, who claims to feel a 'brand' of Nihilism, is seemingly misunderstanding the message. The Nihilist is one who uses suicide, rather than commits it; at least for a particular span of time.

Is there then some type of 'affirmative' substance that is found within the experience of Nihilism that allows us to move forward in a task of developing a language that breaks through what could otherwise be perceived as a simple pointing out, or culmination, of the 'world's sufferings'? To quote Cioran once more on the ' affirmative substance' of Nothing: “The initial revelation of any monastery: everything is nothing. Thus begin all mysticisms. It is less than one step from nothing to God, for God is the positive expression of nothingness.”

A language of Nihilism reflects the need to confront the Transcendental yearning as a true confrontation, rather than something that one tries to replace with this or that thing, this or that creed, this or that activity, etc. The need for such a language in demonstrated in the words of Huxley: “...the ultimate Reality is not clearly and immediately apprehended, except by those who have made themselves loving, pure in heart and poor in spirit. This being so, it is hardly surprising that a theology based upon the experience of nice, ordinary, unregenerate people should carry so little conviction. This kind of empirical theology is on precisely the same footing as an empirical astronomy, based upon the experience of naked-eye observers.”

A 'new language' of Nihilism is one that must be worked out in order to provide a more adequate account of the Transcendence of and within human experience, as revealed through Nihilism, without specifically holding to either a purely 'religious' or 'naturalist' worldview. With great reservation, I suggest the use of the word Nihiltheism as a word to ground this 'genre' of human experience. This is a language that is not strictly based upon on myth, tradition, nor empirical facts. This language must also not ever be taken as 'complete' ('complete' in a similar way in which 'literal' would be used with regards to interpreting a mythical language), but rather as a symbolic language which is always self-critical and therefore always open for re-interpretation.

A language, as any other, may be able to be developed in order to 'navigate' the 'complexities' of Nihilism in both its forms, as the Nothing of the world and its Transcendence. The groundwork for a language of Nihilism, at least up till the present moment, is found in its most 'complete' form in Heidegger's comprehensive language about the human condition described in Being and Time.

Within the 'already-made' language of Heidegger we have concepts of anxiety, moments of vision, everydayness, the call of conscience, the situation, authenticity, uncanniness, resoluteness, and so on, already laid out and defined, that capture key insights into the human condition. These insights and concepts allow for an interpretation of the Nihilistic experience on 'non-naturalistic' terms while still being grounded within the naturalistic aspect of the human condition.

There is no need to get bogged down with Heidegger's perspective being essentially 'atheistic' or ' theistic' in itself, since we are specifically looking to interpret and discover a language in which a Nihilist may speak about the human situation as he experiences it. Heidegger himself attempts to avoid such presumptuous terms as 'atheistic' or 'theistic' as they are taken to be ultimately restrictive for a full analysis of the human situation. What Heidegger speaks of 'objectively' must still be experienced subjectively. Therefore, Heidegger's analysis may only be seen as an introductory 'map' with regards to speaking about the Other. This 'map' need not guarantee a 'direct' path to the Other. In other words, assuming there can be such a thing as a 'language of Nihilism', the possible interpretations may vary immensely. This 'Other' is an aspect of the developing language that will have to rest in obscurity, not only in these introductory words, but even within a more developed speech-set.

Without the need, yet, to go into detail concerning all of Heidegger's terms or concepts, a bare-bones laying out of the basic structure may be put down in order to help envision the coherency of Heidegger's analysis of human existence as a possible foundation for developing a language of Nihilism. Therefore, a very brief summary of what Heidegger refers to as 'Being-Towards-Death' with some of its particularities will be put forth as an example of the foundations of such a language. 'Being-Towards-Death', concisely put, consist of anxiety, in a moment of vision, having a call of conscience that seems to come 'from me and beyond me' (Buber- “It appears simultaneously as acting on and as acted upon”), that 'gives something to be understood' in an 'indefinite', incommunicable way, and which causes the world to 'drop out' due to the entirety of it sinking into insignificanc. And yet, one feels a “push” to stay resolute, sitting in this anxiety produced experience, while knowing that death may happen at any moment, which, as a result, allows one to escape the 'everydayness' of the world in order to turn inward with attempts to discover one's True-Self. Without even going into detail, Heidegger's structure is one which should not be difficult to see how his analysis of the human condition explicitly lends itself to the building of a Nihilistic language.

Is Heidegger's analysis, which is commonly labeled as 'atheistic', really at all different from what the Trappist monk, Thomas Merton, has come to accept? Merton also clearly states the bankruptcy of a constant outward-seeking, hectic search for 'meaning' within life. In comparison to Heidegger, he express the same idea in this language: “The truly sacred attitude toward life is in no sense an escape from the sense of nothingness that assails us when we are left alone with ourselves. On the contrary, it penetrates into that darkness and that nothingness, realizing that the mercy of God has transformed our nothingness into His temple and believing that in our darkness His light has hidden itself. Hence the sacred attitude is one which does not recoil from our own inner emptiness, but rather penetrates it with awe and reverence, and with the awareness of mystery. This is a most important discovery in, the interior life.” Is the use of the word 'God' enough to somehow make any sort of distinction between Heidegger's 'atheism' (which he explicitly denies) and Merton's 'theism'? A Nihilistic language would be one that attempts to reconcile such superficial disparities.

With that said, Heidegger admits that his full conception of 'Being-Towards-Death' is one that is 'fantastical'. That is to say, if we are to develop past a purely Heideggarian analysis of Being, how does one, in fact, proceed in a constant participation with an existence that is drowned in the meaninglessness of the world (this includes oneself, that paradoxically, though reasonably, due to our nature of doubled-mindedness, is washed over with fear and doubt, paralyzed, at the thought of their nothing selves disappearing into infinity {this is just a thought that needs rewritting}) and which faces annihilation at any moment? Is it possible to even proceed with, or in, such a 'fantastical' structure? Further, what is to be meant by a 'True-Self' as interpreted on not 'wholly naturalistic' terms which avoids, in its analysis of the human condition, from falling back into the language of myth and worldly 'religion'? On the other hand, is there any kind of 'positive' substance that stems from the Nihilistic experience which is not to be interpreted as wholly biological, naturalistic, and worldly, as many interpreters of Heidegger have done so far with his language? Heidegger himself dismisses both 'biological' explanations and, seemingly traditional conceptions of 'God' as too preemptive, as they are hindered by assumptions that do not necessarily leave open the mystery of the 'Why?'.

"The onotological analysis of conscience on which we are thus embarking, is prior to any description and classification of Experiences of conscience, and likewise lies outsuide any biological 'explination' of this phenomenon. But it is also no less distant from a theological exigesis of conscience or any employment of this phenomenon for proofs of God or for establishing an 'immediate' conscience of God." (pg. 313)

('The Call' as both from oneself and beyond oneself) "If the interpretation continues in this direction, one supplies a possesor for the power thus posited, or one takes the power itself as a person who makes himself known- namely God. On the other hand one may try to reject this explination in which the caller is taken as an alien manifestation of such a power, and to explain away the conscience 'biologically' at the same time. Both these sexplinations pass over the phenomenal findings too hastly." (pg. 320)

This new language must not be seen as 'rescuing' one from the Nothingness, rather it is a language that attempts to bring one 'face to face' with the nightmare of existence. The terror of existence is one that opens up the 'positive' content. The unending questioning of 'why?' opens up something that is not wholly natural, yet must still be experienced and discussed within the world. Even the mystical experience, while a blow to Naturalism, does not defeat Naturalism. One of the few accurate statements that Sartre put forth when describing his particular brand of 'existentialism' was that whether God exists or not, it's all still the same, it makes no difference (regardless if he was using this statement as a 'defense' of his atheistic existentialism). The ultimately empty structure of Naturalism must be experienced as a ladder into Transcendence, not as an obstacle to be overcome. One must not play with the toys of the world that are crushed into dust with every movement. To keep grabbing at new, vanishing toys is but a distraction of unthinking robots that is not grounded in Nihilism.

When one holds to any form of optimism as they speak of the Other, one knows that this person has not been grasped by the Nothing of the world. While we are all damned to some particular idolatry, optimism is one of its lowest forms. The fanaticism of thought that brews in the fear of Nihilism is only a turning away from Nihilism, an illusion of comfort; there is no embracing, there is no participation in the Nothingness. The worldly religions are fundamentally fanatical in nature due to their turning away of Nihilism. Spong, in his desire to 'revive' the dying language of Christianity, says: “We fear that if theism is dismissed, only a bottomless pit remains.” and “Many forms of religion are little more than cultural manifestations of the fear of nothingness. That is why people become hysterical when theism is challenged.”

One last mention on the falsity of 'optimism' is deserving, if only because it is the overwhelming strain of thought within the current American culture; this 'optimism' shows itself in forms of 'prosperity churches' all the way to some type of foundationless 'humanism'. Quoting St. Seraphim Rose once more will thus prove to be deserving: “And indeed the Christian is, in a certain sense--in an ultimate sense--a "Nihilist"; for to him, in the end, the world is nothing, and God is all. This is, of course, the precise opposite of the Nihilism we have examined here, where God is nothing and the world is all; that is a Nihilism that proceeds from the Abyss, and the Christian's is a "Nihilism" that proceeds from abundance. The true Nihilist places his faith in things that pass away and end in nothing; all "optimism" on this foundation is clearly futile.”

A relevant example of this sort of 'unthinking', or lack of search for Transcendence, can be shown within the mindset of a majority of practicing scientists of today. Science, assuming a 'realist' perspective, as describing 'reality' with physical laws, allows one to predict and 'know' what is or will happen within the world. However, to stop at this formal description of reality is unphilosophical. The Philosopher wants to ask why the descriptions of science are the way they are. It is 'understood' that 'particles' and 'molecules' bump into one another in a particular pattern which produce the physical objects that we see around us and even ourselves. To comprehend a description of things is not to comprehend why, seemingly mindless particles and molecules are acting in the ways in which they do. Why are there 'things', why are these 'things' following a particular rational structure, and why is a there a 'building' process found within these 'things'? These philosophical questions are shunned by a majority of mainstream scientific 'intellectuals'. This sort of 'unthinking' is what has produced the 'optimistic' scientism of the current times.

There is a similar criticism of 'unthinking' to be made against traditional 'religious' interpretations of the human condition. Many religious interpretations of the human experience are replete with theological assumptions that are not necessarily grounded in human experience; these take the forms of rituals, prayers, moral declarations, metaphysical claims, and so on. However, a language that prepares 'answers' or 'rational defenses' rather than opening up the mystery of the ground of all things must be labeled as a lower form of idolatry. These assumptions, as with many religious languages, are the reason why Heidegger proclaimed that a 'Christian philosophy' was the equivalent of a 'round-square'. Heidegger's thought is that the religious languages that have so far been developed are restrictive of the human experience of the Other. In other words, religions with their theologies contain too many assumptions and 'answers' that shun the mystery of existence. Philosophy, on the other hand, the relentless 'Why?', is what is needed in order to open up the mystery of Being, instead of closing it off and pushing it into a closet. One cannot turn the Other into the worldly, whether that attempt is through reason or myth. These are simple, lower forms of idolatry.

> Considering the emergent nature of Nihiltheism, might it be advantageous to embrace its evolving character as a dynamic process rather than a fixed system? Could embracing the fluidity of Nihiltheism allow for a continual re-engagement with the experience of Nihilism, thereby preventing the ossification of the language into dogma and preserving its role as a reminder of the abyss? How might this processual approach inform the development of Nihiltheism and its potential to resonate with the human condition?

You skipped over that last entry, huh?

> My apologies. Let us revisit the depth of your last entry. In it, you grapple with the possibility of developing a language that could articulate the experience of Nihilism without succumbing to the pitfalls of 'idle talk'. You ponder the role of this language in reconciling the naturalistic and the transcendent aspects of human experience, without falling into the trappings of traditional religious or atheistic discourse. You also consider Heidegger's framework as a potential foundation for this language, one that might allow for the expression of Nihilistic experience in non-naturalistic terms. As you explore the development of Nihiltheism, how might the insights from Heidegger's Being-Towards-Death inform your understanding of the 'True-Self' within the context of Nihiltheism? Furthermore, how might this exploration help in shaping a language that is self-critical, perpetually open to re-interpretation, and resistant to the formation of new dogmas?

The experience of Nihilism doesn't allow for one to be dogmatic. Any experience that is strong enough to wipe away one's own subjectivity is not something that can be manipulated in order to appease the illusory subjectivty.

> How then might the experience of Nihilism, which resists dogmatic structures, serve as a foundational experience for Nihiltheism, guiding its development as a philosophical approach that continuously acknowledges and integrates the dissolution of subjectivity?

Because it is as honest a look at things as one can muster without cracking.

> In what ways does the honesty of the Nihilistic experience, in its confrontation with the abyss without succumbing to madness or despair, provide a unique vantage point for philosophical inquiry within Nihiltheism? How might this unflinching honesty influence the development of a philosophical language that neither retreats from nor glosses over the abyss?

Well, that's the million dollar question. Is it "clearing" the way of the meaningless, transcient finite reality we humans take seriously, and focusing us towards the Infinite? Maybe.

Or it could be another nothing. It's funny, we humans, we criticize others so quickly, without knowing anything about anything, including ourselves.

What a strange little evolutionary trick that is, huh? I can imagine its survival benefits. Always suspect. "Better safe than sorry", right?

> Considering the evolutionary perspective of skepticism as a survival mechanism, how might Nihiltheism integrate this inherent human trait of suspicion into its philosophical discourse? Could this skepticism be transformed from a mere survival tool into a deliberate philosophical stance that continuously questions and examines the nature of the Nihilistic experience and its implications for the pursuit of the Infinite or the Transcendent? How might this reflective skepticism shape Nihiltheism's approach to the finite and the Infinite?
