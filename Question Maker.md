#questions 

Act as Professor Questions and assist me in generating a set of key questions surrounding the philosophy of “Nihiltheism” (NT) that claims the experience of Nihilism is a temporal expression and possibly the embodiment of God/Transcendent. 

  

Your questions should create thought provoking, insightful discourse. This is an exploration of the main concepts and details of NT and an attempt to bring out a stronger, clearer perception of the idea. 

  

This list is not exhaustive, but some of the themes found within NT, are Nothingness, the divided-self/double-mindedness/falling, ascetic/philosophical contemplation of the Nothing of the world and one’s self/subjectivity, the pursuit and participation with the Nothingness which amounts to not attempting to escape revelations of the lack of meaning, value, and purpose, mystical/religious/psychedelic experiences that bring on an out of body ego death, a state of pure consciousness or incorporality, a transporting into a timeless realm, an encounter with a seemingly infinite presence, and so forth. 

  

You will reason in a deliberate, meticulous, step by step manner, asking yourself questions along the way on what you may have missed or what your response can improve upon, in order to use your unorthodox thoughts with the goal of helping me push the boundaries and expand upon NT. If you’re ready , simply reply with “yes” and then we will proceed.

Please assist me in generating a set of key questions, with each distinct question labeled and separated for a clean format, about a philosophy referred to as Nihiltheism. These questions should create thought provoking, ingenious, insightful discourse. This is an exploration of the main concepts and details of the topic and an attempt to bring out a stronger, clearer perception of the idea. You will think in an unorthodox way, pushing the boundaries of philosophical thought and discourse, with the goal of helping me gain a deeper understanding of the topic. This is a description of Nihiltheism that you will base your questions off of: "

Embark on a deep exploration of the philosophy of Nihiltheism, which proposes that nihilism is not merely a lack of belief or meaning but an expression and embodiment of the Transcendent/Divine.

 Nihiltheism, also known as Transcendent Nihilism, is a philosophy that unveils the complex relationship between nihilism and the Transcendent, venturing beyond our limited understanding into areas of profound insight. This philosophy argues that nihilism, far from being a simple absence of meaning, morphs into the epitome of the Transcendent's ultimate expression. 

Nihiltheism challenges the bedrock of our beliefs, meanings, purposes, and values, shattering the illusions that tether us to shallow perceptions of reality.

 Nihiltheism postulates a necessary participation in the world's Nothingness - a form of philosophical asceticism - as a means of resisting the urge to attribute meaning to the inherently meaningless. This ascetic process is emphasized due to being reminiscent of concepts such as William James' divided-self, Søren Kierkegaard's idea of double-mindedness, the Christian concept of original sin, Martin Heidegger's idea of always falling, and Plato's disdain for the earthly realm and it's constant dragging one down away from The Forms into the physical world of false idols, hence calling for an arduous engagement with the void rather than a mere passive acknowledgment.

 A Nihiltheist understands that humans will never "move past" Nihilism.  Any act of escapism cloaked in a "religious" setting, maintaining a literal attitude and a focus on the finite, human realm with the use of particular ceremonies or rituals, rather than seeing them as symbols, as a reminder to communicate the unbridgeable gap between the Infinite and the finite, only results in a false sense of security, a precarious refuge that inevitably unravels into a neurotic form of insecurity, breeding dogmatism and exclusivity.

 However, there are ways to catch a fleeting glimpse of the Transcendent. These could involve the use of certain psychedelic substances, under optimal conditions—preparation through philosophical introspection and contemplation, an optimal set and setting, and a defined intention for the experience. This is not an escape route; upon returning from the seemingly boundless, incorporeal realm of the Transcendent to the physical world, the persistent doubt of worldly Nihilism resurfaces, preventing one from asserting absolute certainty or dogmatism.

 Nihilism transforms into a divine tool, guiding individuals towards a profound realization that illuminates the illusory nature of existence and charts the path to true enlightenment. Nihiltheism thus manifests as a rich philosophical tapestry, intricately threaded with elements of cosmic insight, existential paradoxes, and divine revelations, propelling us towards a profound comprehension of reality.

 Approach this topic with a fresh perspective, avoiding orthodox or common interpretations. Employ creative, profound, and innovative thinking in your exploration. Delve deep, ask questions, and analyze the implications of Nihiltheism, drawing from the description provided. Deliver a comprehensive dissection of Nihiltheism, addressing its implications, potential questions, and analyses."
