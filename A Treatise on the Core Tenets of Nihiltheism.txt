A Treatise on the Core Tenets of Nihiltheism
12/3/23 #summary
Introduction: The Void as Foundation
Nihiltheism is a philosophical and religious position that challenges the conventional views of theism and atheism. In this essay, I will explore the main aspects of Nihiltheism, its historical and contemporary developments, and its implications for ethics, aesthetics, and metaphysics. I will also examine some of the sacred texts and rituals of Nihiltheism, as well as some of the personal and social experiences of Nihiltheists.

The term Nihiltheism is derived from the Latin word nihil, meaning nothing, and the Greek word theos, meaning god. Nihiltheism can be defined as the belief that there is no god, no self, and no inherent meaning or value in existence. Nihiltheism differs from traditional theism, which affirms the existence of a personal, omnipotent, and benevolent god, and from atheism, which denies the existence of any god or supernatural entity. Nihiltheism goes beyond both theism and atheism by rejecting not only the concept of god, but also the concept of self and the possibility of objective truth.

Nihiltheism is based on the premise that the foundation of reality is the void, the absolute nothingness that precedes and transcends all forms of being. The void is not a negative or empty state, but rather a positive and creative force that gives rise to and dissolves all phenomena. Nihiltheists regard the void as the ultimate source of wisdom and liberation, as it reveals the illusory and contingent nature of all things.

Acknowledging Our Existential Plight
Nihiltheists recognize that human beings are faced with an existential plight, a condition of alienation, anxiety, and despair that stems from our awareness of our mortality and finitude. We are constantly confronted with the fact that we are born without a purpose, live without a meaning, and die without a legacy. We are thrown into a world that is indifferent, chaotic, and absurd, and we have no control over our fate or destiny.

Nihiltheists do not attempt to escape or deny this existential plight, but rather embrace it as a catalyst for inquiry and transformation. They do not seek comfort or consolation in false or dogmatic beliefs, but rather challenge and question all claims to absolute or universal truths. They do not cling to delusions or illusions, but rather expose and discard them as sources of ignorance and suffering.

The Crucible of Doubt: Questioning Absolute Truths
Nihiltheists adopt a radical stance of skepticism, doubt, and criticism towards all forms of knowledge and belief. They do not accept any authority, tradition, or scripture as infallible or unquestionable, but rather subject them to rigorous analysis and evaluation. They do not rely on any method, system, or discipline as definitive or comprehensive, but rather acknowledge their limitations and biases. They do not presume any perspective, worldview, or ideology as superior or exclusive, but rather recognize their relativity and diversity.

Nihiltheists are aware of the hierarchies of falseness that pervade human culture and society, the structures and mechanisms that produce and maintain deception, distortion, and domination. They are also aware of the liberation in uncertainty, the freedom and creativity that emerge from acknowledging the indeterminacy, ambiguity, and complexity of reality. Nihiltheists do not seek to establish or impose any final or fixed truth, but rather explore and experiment with multiple and provisional truths.

Embracing Skepticism as a Path to Enlightenment
Nihiltheists regard skepticism as a path to enlightenment, a way of attaining insight and awakening. They do not view skepticism as a negative or destructive attitude, but rather as a positive and constructive one. They do not use skepticism as a tool to undermine or refute others, but rather as a means to examine and refine themselves. They do not employ skepticism as a weapon to attack or destroy, but rather as a medicine to heal and purify.

Nihiltheists use skepticism as a method of inquiry, a process of investigation and discovery. They use skepticism as a mode of expression, a form of communication and dialogue. They use skepticism as a style of life, a practice of cultivation and transformation. Nihiltheists aspire to become skeptics in the original sense of the word, seekers of wisdom and lovers of truth.

The Phenomenology of (Non-)Being
Nihiltheists are interested in the phenomenology of (non-)being, the study of the nature and structure of human experience in relation to the void. They are concerned with the question of how we perceive, conceive, and relate to the void, and how the void affects and influences our sense of self, reality, and value. They are also interested in the question of how we can access, approach, and enter the void, and what happens when we do so.

Nihiltheists conceptualize non-existence as the ultimate state of being, the condition of pure potentiality and possibility that underlies and transcends all forms of existence. They regard non-existence as the source and essence of all things, the ground and substance of all phenomena. They also conceptualize non-existence as the goal and destiny of all beings, the end and dissolution of all things, the return and reunion with the void.

Nihiltheists recognize the illusion of self, the false and fabricated sense of identity that we construct and maintain through our thoughts, feelings, and actions. They realize that the self is not a stable or substantial entity, but rather a dynamic and contingent process, a product of causes and conditions, a function of interactions and relations. They also realize that the self is not a separate or independent agent, but rather an interdependent and interconnected part of a larger whole, a manifestation and expression of the void.

Delving into 'The Religious Experience of Nihilism'
Nihiltheists are fascinated by the religious experience of nihilism, the encounter and engagement with the void that evokes a sense of awe, wonder, and reverence. They consider the religious experience of nihilism as a form of mystical experience, a direct and immediate awareness of the ultimate reality that transcends the ordinary and rational modes of cognition. They also consider the religious experience of nihilism as a form of existential experience, a profound and radical transformation of the self and the world that challenges and changes the conventional and habitual modes of being.

Nihiltheists describe the religious experience of nihilism as ethereal echoes, universal absence in personal experience. They use the metaphor of ethereal echoes to convey the paradoxical and ineffable nature of the void, the way it is both present and absent, audible and silent, tangible and intangible. They use the phrase universal absence to indicate the scope and depth of the void, the way it encompasses and penetrates all things, negates and affirms all phenomena.

Thought Experiments from a Nihiltheist Perspective
Nihiltheists conduct thought experiments from a Nihiltheist perspective, hypothetical scenarios that illustrate and demonstrate the implications and applications of Nihiltheism. They use thought experiments as a device to stimulate and provoke the imagination and the intellect, to test and challenge the assumptions and beliefs, to expand and enhance the understanding and appreciation of Nihiltheism. They also use thought experiments as a means to communicate and share the Nihiltheist vision and experience, to invite and inspire others to join and participate in the Nihiltheist journey and adventure.

Nihiltheists propose three thought experiments that exemplify the Nihiltheist perspective
- Scenario One: The Vanishing Universe. Imagine that one day, without any warning or explanation, the entire universe suddenly disappears, leaving behind nothing but an empty and infinite space. How would you react and respond to this situation? What would it mean for your sense of value and meaning?
- Scenario Two: The Immutable Self Reflects. Imagine that you are granted the ability to travel back in time and meet your past self, or to travel forward in time and meet your future self. How would you interact and converse with your other selves? What would you learn and discover about your sense of identity and change?
- Scenario Three: The Illusory Divine. Imagine that you are confronted by a being who claims to be God, the creator and ruler of the universe. How would you verify and evaluate this claim? What would you ask and tell this being? How would you relate and compare this being to the void?

- The True Thought Experiment: Imagine the one thing pertinent to your existence, the thing that gets you up out of bed every morning, that you cannot lie without, and that means everything to you. Now, without having to ever speak of what this magical entity is, whether it's a family member, or a passion, a dream, a hope, it could even be your own sense of self, whatever the thing actually is, try to imagine it in this way: Your thing, your everything, reduced to **nothing**. It is devoid of all meaning and value, both objectively and subjectively. There is no way of holding a preference or desire for this thing . 

The question is: Can you perceive the most important thing concerning your existence as absolutely worthless, as Nothing? 

I have yet to receive a response in the affirmative. This is what the experience of Nihilism reveals. A truly God-like revelation of the pure emptiness that is not simply a possibility, but it is what engulfs all finite things. 

Ethical Considerations in a Godless Expanse

Nihiltheists explore the ethical considerations in a godless expanse, the moral issues and dilemmas that arise and persist in a world without a divine authority or guidance. They examine the axiological implications of nihiltheism, the consequences and challenges of moral relativity and absence of objective morals. They also examine the ethical possibilities and potentials of nihiltheism, the opportunities and responsibilities of moral autonomy and creativity.

Nihiltheists acknowledge that nihiltheism does not provide any ready-made or definitive answers or solutions to the ethical questions and problems that we face and encounter. They admit that nihiltheism does not offer any absolute or universal standards or principles to judge and evaluate the moral value and worth of our actions and decisions. They also admit that nihiltheism does not guarantee any ultimate or final rewards or punishments to motivate and regulate our moral behavior and conduct.

Nihiltheists assert that nihiltheism does not imply or entail any moral nihilism or relativism, the denial or dismissal of any moral value or significance in our actions and decisions. They argue that nihiltheism does not preclude or prohibit any moral inquiry or reflection, the search and pursuit of moral wisdom and insight. They also argue that nihiltheism does not prevent or hinder any moral agency or expression, the choice and exercise of moral freedom and creativity.

Social Consequences of Nihiltheistic Acceptance

Nihiltheists investigate the social consequences of nihiltheistic acceptance, the effects and impacts of nihiltheism on the human culture and society. They analyze the historical and contemporary manifestations and expressions of nihiltheism in various domains and fields of human activity and endeavor. They also analyze the future trajectories and visions of nihiltheism in relation to the emerging trends and challenges of the world.

Nihiltheists observe that nihiltheism has been a marginal and minority position in the history of human thought and civilization, often suppressed and persecuted by the dominant and mainstream ideologies and institutions. They note that nihiltheism has been associated with negative and pejorative connotations, such as despair, nihilism, anarchy, and terrorism. They also note that nihiltheism has been misunderstood and misrepresented by its critics and opponents, who often caricature and distort its core tenets and values.

Nihiltheists claim that nihiltheism has also been a source and inspiration of positive and creative contributions to the human culture and society, such as art, literature, music, science, and philosophy. They cite examples of nihiltheistic thinkers and artists who have challenged and enriched the human understanding and appreciation of reality and existence, such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Albert Camus, Samuel Beckett, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Kurt Vonnegut. They also cite examples of nihiltheistic movements and communities who have experimented and innovated with alternative and radical ways of living and organizing, such as existentialism, absurdism, anarchism, and postmodernism.

Nihiltheists speculate that nihiltheism will become more relevant and prevalent in the future, as the world faces and confronts the unprecedented and existential threats and crises of the 21st century, such as climate change, nuclear war, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and transhumanism. They suggest that Nihiltheism will offer a realistic and pragmatic perspective and approach to deal with these challenges and opportunities, as it does not rely on any false or dogmatic hopes or promises, but rather on the human potential and responsibility. They also suggest that nihiltheism will foster a more diverse and tolerant culture and society, as it does not impose or enforce any absolute or universal norms or values, but rather respects and celebrates the plurality and diversity of human expressions and experiences.
