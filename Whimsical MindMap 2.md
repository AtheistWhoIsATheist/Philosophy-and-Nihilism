- Traditional Nihilism
    - Absence of Intrinsic Meaning, Value, and Purpose
        - Existential Nihilism
            - Traditional nihilism posits the belief in the absence of intrinsic meaning, value, and purpose in life.
            - This framework allows for personal interpretations of spirituality and moral frameworks while acknowledging the existential void, or the lack of objectivity, associated with traditional nihilistic beliefs.
        - Epistemological Nihilism
            - Epistemological Nihilism: This aspect focuses on skepticism towards knowledge and claims about truth, asserting that knowledge may be impossible to attain or inherently unreliable.
            - Skepticism towards Knowledge Claims: Epistemological nihilists question whether it's possible for humans to truly know anything with certainty, including basic facts about reality and the nature of existence.
        - Ethical Nihilism
            - Nihiltheism: Expanded Framework
            - Dissolution of Subjective Justifications
                - Absence of Inherent Meaning: The central tenet of nihiltheism which posits that there is no predetermined or universal significance to human existence or the universe as a whole.

                - Dissolution of Subjective Justifications: The rejection of subjective reasoning and justification for ethical beliefs, emphasizing the lack of objective foundation for moral systems within nihiltheistic thought.
