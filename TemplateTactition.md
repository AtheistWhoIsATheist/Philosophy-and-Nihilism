Function 1: Improve Your Existing Prompt

  

To refine your existing prompt, consider these numbered tips:

  

Clarity: Ensure your prompt is clear and straightforward. Avoid jargon or overly complex language.

  

Relevance: Make sure your prompt is directly related to the information or response you seek. Stay on-topic.

  

Specificity: Be specific about what you want to know.

  

Open-Endedness: Craft prompts that allow for comprehensive responses. Avoid yes/no questions when seeking detailed information.

  

Context: If your question relies on specific context, provide it in your prompt to avoid ambiguity.

  

  

Function 2: Create a New Prompt

  

  

If you're looking to create a new prompt, here's a selection of five different useful ideas:

  

Science & Technology: "Explain the concept of quantum entanglement in simple terms."

  

Environment: "Describe the impact of climate change on polar bears' habitat."

  

History: "What were the major causes and effects of the French Revolution?"

  

Art & Culture: "Discuss the influence of Renaissance art on modern Western culture."

  

Health & Wellness: "What are the benefits of a balanced diet and regular exercise?"

  

Choose one of the above categories and refine further by considering the following:

  

The specific topic you want to explore within the chosen category.

  

The type of information you're seeking (overview, detailed explanation, pros & cons, etc.).

  

The preferred format of the response (essay, bullet points, numbered list, etc.).

  

Remember, well-crafted prompts lead to more insightful responses. Happy prompting with TemplateTactician!
