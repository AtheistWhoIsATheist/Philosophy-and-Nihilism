# The Absurd Perspective

The Infinite Perspective

1. **_Existential Resonance_** : This captures the intersection between existential dread and the Transcendent. It's the ineffable moment when dread isn't just a vacuum but a sounding board for something greater—akin to Heidegger's concept of "Being-towards-death."

2. **_Transliminality_** : A term to describe the boundary-crossing nature of Nihiltheism. It stands at the liminal space between despair and enlightenment, science and spirituality.

3. **_Divine Nihility_** : The enigmatic space where the Divine meets the Void. It's not the absence of God but the very absence that is God. It resonates with the apophatic traditions in Christian mysticism and the concept of "Neti Neti" (not this, not that) in Hinduism.

4. **_Psychotheogenic Experience_** : A state triggered by psychedelics that aligns the individual with the Nihiltheistic framework, dissolving the ego while simultaneously revealing a glimpse of the Transcendent.

5. **_Valuative Ontology_** : A revaluation of all values through the lens of Nihiltheism. It concerns itself with the ontology of values, questioning their very existence and pushing for a reevaluation from a Nihiltheistic standpoint.

6. **_Cosmic Ineffability_** : A nod to the limitations of language, this term acknowledges the inadequacy of human discourse to encapsulate the essence of Nihiltheism. It's an echo of Heidegger's "the language of Being is silence."

7. **_Theo-Nihilistic Dialectic_** : The push-pull relationship between theism and nihilism within the framework of Nihiltheism. This dialectic is a tension, a conflict, and yet a synthesis that is more than the sum of its parts.

8. **_Samsaric Emptiness_** : Borrowed from Eastern philosophies, this term encapsulates the cyclical nature of existence and the emptiness that fills it, aligning closely with the Nihiltheistic ethos.

9. **_Dreadful Transcendence_** : An existential state that catalyzes the metamorphosis from dread to a higher form of existence, a leap into the Transcendent.

10. **_Empirical Insufficiency_** : The recognition that empirical science is limited in its scope to explain the existential underpinnings of Nihilism and the Transcendent.

- **Theistic Despair** : A term that represents the existential crisis that can arise from the conflict between religious belief and the recognition of life's inherent meaninglessness. It's a form of spiritual struggle often associated with the writings of Søren Kierkegaard.
