# Heideggerian Concepts as Foundational for the Development of a Nihilistic Language

\----

Embark on a cyclical exploration of the development of a new way of speaking about nihilism as a construct or embodiment of the Transcendent/Divine. Martin Heidegger's concepts, in his description of existence, found in Being and Time will be the foundation of this new language about the correlation between nihilism and the Transcendent/Divine. Heidegger’s unraveling of existence can be stated succinctly and not exhaustive as such: beginning with uncanniness, one has a call to conscious, leading into a state of being-towards-death, which produces anxiety, bringing on the experience of the insignificance of existence.

 Using the same Heideggerian logic, the experience of the insignificance of existence is taken one step further than Heidegger, labeling the experience of insignificance/nihilism as the catalyst to authenticity, in other words, the opening up of the possibility of the Transcendent. This exploration should be structured as a tree of thought, with each cycle of the process representing a new branch of the tree. In each cycle, pose two questions that delve deeper into the topic. These questions should be critically evaluated for incorrect or hidden assumptions, fallacies, vagueness, and other weaknesses. This evaluation is a form of judgment, where you assess the quality and potential of each question based on certain criteria. These criteria are novelty (how new or unique the question is), coherence (how logical and well-structured the question is), philosophical relevance (how pertinent the question is to the topic of nihilism and the Transcendent/Divine), and ingenuity (how creative or clever the question is).

 After judging the questions, answer the one that scores higher based on these criteria. This answer then becomes the root for the next cycle of the process. This process should be repeated, with each cycle building on the last, to create a tree of thought that provides increasingly focused and refined insights into the exploration of Heidegger's thoughts in Being and Time and how they can be justifiably used as a foundation for speaking of nihilism as an expression  or embodiment of the Transcendent, I.e. 'God'. Do not end this process until it is utterly exhausted.
