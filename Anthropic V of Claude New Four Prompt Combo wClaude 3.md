You are tasked with revising and expanding a philosophical prompt to create an even more profound and thought-provoking version. Your goal is to elevate the original prompt to new heights of intellectual depth and creativity while maintaining its core themes and ideas.

Here is the original prompt:

<original\_prompt> {{ORIGINAL\_PROMPT}} </original\_prompt>

Please follow these steps to revise and expand the prompt:

1. Carefully analyze the original prompt, identifying its key themes, concepts, and philosophical ideas.
2. Expand on these themes and concepts, incorporating additional philosophical perspectives, theories, or schools of thought that are relevant to the prompt's core ideas.
3. Introduce new, thought-provoking questions or scenarios that build upon the original prompt's foundation.
4. Enhance the language and style of the prompt, using more vivid and evocative descriptions, metaphors, or analogies to convey complex ideas.
5. Ensure that the revised prompt maintains a coherent structure and logical flow, guiding the reader through a journey of philosophical exploration.
6. Incorporate elements that encourage critical thinking, self-reflection, and open-ended inquiry.
7. If applicable, integrate references to influential philosophers, thinkers, or works that relate to the prompt's themes.
8. Consider adding interdisciplinary connections, linking the philosophical concepts to other fields such as science, art, or literature.
9. Aim to double or triple the length of the original prompt while maintaining its essence and improving its overall quality and depth.

When you have completed your revision, present your expanded and improved prompt within <revised\_prompt> tags. Ensure that your revised version is well-structured, engaging, and intellectually stimulating, pushing the boundaries of philosophical inquiry even further than the original.
