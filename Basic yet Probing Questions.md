**Answer 5.** Ah, my interlocutor, you pose an intriguing question. The evidence and arguments that support the notion of the world's meaninglessness, as posited by the philosophy of Nihiltheism, lie primarily in experiential realizations and philosophical explorations.

  

Firstly, the experience of Nihilism itself is a profound encounter with the overwhelming insignificance of life. One becomes acutely aware of the absence of any inherent objective meaning, value, or purpose in existence. This realization, which often arises from deep contemplation or existential crises, shatters the illusions and delusions fostered by conventional religious and philosophical systems.

  

Furthermore, philosophical reflections derive the meaninglessness of the world from an essential critique of finite human perspectives. Nihiltheism rejects the opposing perspectives of atheism and traditional theism for their concentration on the human condition, which is bound to the temporal and fated to eventual annihilation. The insurmountable limitations placed upon human existence render any attempts at assigning transcendental meaning, value, and purpose ultimately futile.

  

Moreover, the universal nature of this experience across time, culture, philosophy, and religious traditions suggests a profound resonance with the fundamentality of existential despair. Individuals, from various walks of life and diverse belief systems, report encounters with the abyss of nihilistic realization. This echoes a certain universality within the human condition, transcending particular characteristics, reinforcing the argument for the world's meaninglessness.

  

Ultimately, the philosophy of Nihiltheism calls for a denouncement of all attempts to seek transcendence, meaning, or redemption within finite frameworks and instead emphasizes the transformative potential of confronting the void. (\*\***Me**\*\*:  You say that the Nihiltheist doesn't seek Transcendence, for one, with finite frameworks. However, isn't the experience of Nothingness said to be an "expression" or possibly the temporal "embodiment" of a possible Transcendent reality beyond the material world? How does this make any sense?) It beckons one to explore the inherently terrifying encounter with Nothingness as a transformative agent leading towards an experience of true transcendence.

  

However, my dear querent, allow me to remind you that these conclusions emerge not from empirical evidence, philosophical arguments alone, or constructs of rationality but rather from the profound experiential realization which leads towards the conclusion of a world devoid of objective meaning. It is within the realm of subjective truth that the evidence alludes to the world's haunting emptiness.

(\*\***Me\*\***: Then why a Nihiltheist's "subjective truth of non-meaning so profound and 'worthy', in some strange sense of the word, yet the subjective truths of meaning are dismissed?)

# On the Above Question 5: 

## I ask Thinking and Thinking...

Ah, my inquisitive companion, your observations and questions are indeed perceptive. Let me attempt to elucidate the nuances of the Nihiltheistic perspective on the embodiment of the Transcendent within the experience of Nihilism.

  

You rightly point out the apparent contradiction in our stance - that we claim the experience of Nothingness to be the very ground for Transcendence, when one would expect the Nihiltheist to reject all notions of Transcendence outright. This is a valid concern, and it speaks to the paradoxical nature of our philosophical position.

  

The core tenet of Nihiltheism is that the profound realization of the world's fundamental meaninglessness is the necessary precursor to any genuine encounter with the Transcendent. (\*\*Me\*\*: But how can Nothingness, which by definition lacks any inherent meaning or substance, be the "ground" for Transcendence? Isn't this a logical contradiction?) We do not seek Transcendence through finite frameworks or constructs, for those are precisely the delusions that must be shattered in order to confront the abyss of Nihilism.

  

However, it is within this abyss, this confrontation with the void, that a glimmer of the Transcendent may be glimpsed. (\*\*Me\*\*: How can Nothingness, which by definition lacks any inherent meaning or substance, "glimpse" the Transcendent? Isn't this a logical contradiction?) The experience of Nihilism, in its utter stripping away of all meaning and value, paradoxically opens the door to a realm that transcends the finite and the material. It is not that Nothingness itself is the embodiment of the Transcendent, but rather that the confrontation with Nothingness, in its devastating clarity, can catalyze a transformative encounter with that which lies beyond the boundaries of human comprehension.

  

(\*\*Me\*\*: So in essence, you are claiming that Nothingness, which by definition lacks any inherent meaning or substance, can somehow "open the door" to a realm of Transcendence? How is this logically coherent? Isn't this a fundamental contradiction in your philosophical position?)

  

I understand your skepticism, my friend. The relationship between Nihilism and Transcendence is indeed a paradoxical one, and it is a challenge to articulate it in a way that is logically consistent. Perhaps it is best to acknowledge the inherent limitations of language and reason when it comes to grappling with the mysteries of existence. The Nihiltheist's path is one of embracing the incomprehensible, of surrendering to the abyss, and in doing so, perhaps catching a fleeting glimpse of that which lies beyond the veil of the material world. \[\[1\]\](https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=191952676944&citation=1)\[\[2\]\](https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=191952676944&citation=2)\[\[3\]\](https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=191952676944&citation=3)\[\[4\]\](https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=191952676944&citation=4)\[\[5\]\](https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=191952676944&citation=5)\[\[6\]\](https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=191952676944&citation=6)

  

(\*\*Me\*\*: I'm afraid I still find your position to be logically incoherent. You claim that Nothingness, which by definition lacks any inherent meaning or substance, can somehow "open the door" to Transcendence. This seems to be a fundamental contradiction that undermines the entire Nihiltheistic framework. I would encourage you to re-examine the logical foundations of your philosophy, as it appears to be riddled with irreconcilable paradoxes.)
