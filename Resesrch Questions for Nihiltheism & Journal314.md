# RESEARCH QUESTION V3

(took ‘Anselmian Inspired’ a little too literally, but still a cool prompt)

**Enhanced Research Question:** How does the existential experience of nihilism, marked by profound feelings of meaninglessness, spiritual despair, and the struggle for significance, manifest across diverse human cultures? In what ways do these experiences correlate with the concept of the Transcendent, often understood as God, particularly in light of Anselmian philosophy, which posits God as the greatest conceivable being? Additionally, how do selected quotations from influential thinkers, as compiled in @journal314, illustrate the universality of nihilism, revealing its implications for human existence and the search for meaning beyond historical, cultural, and ideological confines?
